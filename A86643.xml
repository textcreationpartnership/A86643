            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE.</head>
            <p>BEing employ'd some years ago to instruct a Yong Gentleman of an excellent Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, I made it my whole business, to chalk out such a Method for him, as would tend most to his Improvement by his Studies, and render my Instructions effectual.</p>
            <p>In pursuing that Thought, the Knowledge of Languages presented itself to my View, as being a very considerable Accomplishment; and indeed 'tis justly such, both in regard of their own Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and with reference to the Excellency and Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of the Things that by them are convey'd to our Understandings. But upon second Thoughts, I consider'd, that the Noble Birth and towring Genius of my Pupil entitled him to higher Things; and thereupon chose to put him upon the Study of <hi>History,</hi> which is, as 'twere, a Looking-glass for the Actions of Men, and a Directory for Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of Importance. With this View I set about the compiling of a System to be learn'd by Heart and recited, as 'twere by the bye, in order to fasten and rivet the General Heads of Things in his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory. Designing afterwards, as his Age and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
<pb facs="tcp:136207:3"/> advanc'd, to comment upon the same, and furnish him with a clearer Idea of the Springs of Revolutions; the Counsels, Stratagems, and Models of civil Affairs; the success of Projects, and such other things as compleat the Knowledge of History.</p>
            <p>Some of my Friends, that were Men of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Learning, having seen and perus'd the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steme, were mightily pleas'd with the Method; and press'd me to carry on the Scheme to its just Proportions, and finish the Work that would bring at once a considerable Advancement to my own Learning, and some good Services to the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick of Letters, especially to History.</p>
            <p>This their advice was back'd by my own Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which was always bended upon History; and by the hardness of the Times, which superse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded business and made Men fond of retirement, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that the Common saying was then verified, <hi>viz. Qui bene latuit, bene vixit. He was the best Man, that made the least Noise.</hi> Being thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd to go on I finish'd the first Part of my <hi>Institution of History;</hi> which, to my mind, I had enlarg'd to a just size; and publish'd it in our Mother Tongue, by reason that Latin Books of a large bulk and writ by young Authors who are not yet arriv'd at the Glory of a great Name; such Books, I say, go heavily off, and the Men that make Money of 'em carry most of 'em be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sea.</p>
            <p>I shall not spend time in discoursing my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen upon that Book. This is not a place for glorying. Besides, I look upon popular Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause as a meer Vanity. If it do's but meet with the Approbation of the Learned, I shall not mind
<pb facs="tcp:136207:3"/> the Sentiments of others who are blinded by En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy or Ignorance.</p>
            <p>However I have a mind to touch upon upon a things on this occasion, for the sake of those who I think are chiefly concerned. Not that I mean to boast of any great performance: But on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to explain the design and Scheme of the Work, and set a Copy for others, in giving the World to know what I mean'd to do, since in great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings a good meaning uses in some Measure to attone for a slight Performance.</p>
            <p>Since 'tis ridiculous to conceal plain matter of fact; I acknowledge that I dislike all the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Histories or Systems of History, that are yet extant, or, at least, that I have yet seen; and have oftentimes arraign'd 'em, both privatly in my own Breast, and expresly in conference with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of stuffing the mind of young Students with a shapeless and indigested meddley of things, and overpowering their Memories, instead of affording 'em true Information. For some, in carrying down the Thread of <hi>History</hi> from the Creation of the World, fancy they have answer'd the end of their undertaking, by drawing up the Names of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Men and some Hero's, grazeing now and then upon some of their exploits, quoting a few Verses of Scripture, and so skipping thro' the most common Affairs of <hi>Persia,</hi> and passing on to those of the Roman Monarchy, without any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or at least in a very obscure Method; sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never taking notice of the Series and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of things relating to the same Nation, or the Original of Kingdoms and Republicks, or the Successions and Occasional Causes that usher'd in Wars and other Commotions.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:136207:4"/>
            <p>Others again grasp at a greater bulk of things, and make larger Comments upon them; but they are chargeable with the same Crime, I mean, the same perplex'd way of confounding the States and Revolutions of different Kingdoms in one Joynt account; insomuch that one would think that the most different Affairs transacted in Places widely distant from one another, did equally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to one Place of the World, as well as one Paragraph of the Book; and conspir'd in a Joynt Unity of time and reference to the same thing. Such Authors seldom describe the Forms of Ancient Kingdoms and Republicks in <hi>Greece</hi> and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. Indeed they'l give you the Names of their Kings, and some of their Atchievements; but as for their Politick Model, and the Original and Offices of their Magistrates, not a Word of that; nor of the Histories of the <hi>Seleucidae,</hi> the <hi>Ptolomaeus</hi>'s, and the later <hi>Macedonian</hi> Kings, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be a scrap here and there.</p>
            <p>They'll scarce afford to carry the Affairs of <hi>Rome</hi> further back, than the times of <hi>Pyrrhus;</hi> tho' at the same time there's nothing more beneficial to a young Student, than the being acquainted with the Civil Feuds, and Seditions at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the occasions of the several Magistracies that took their rise from thence. One Author follows one Chronological Standard, and another a different one. In one ye'll find several things Contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary, that lye at a distance of time in another. Hence is the Knowledg of ancient times so confus'd, and false glosses put upon true things. By this means, indeed, some scraps of Memorable Stories are pick'd out for a common diversion in Company; but the true and Genuin use of History, the just Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb facs="tcp:136207:4"/> of affairs, the due rank and Succession of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, the Models and Revolutions of Republicks; these are known to very few.</p>
            <p>When I dwelt seriously upon this Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I regrated both my own loss and that of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in wanting the particular Histories of Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Nations; for I could not meet with any thing of that nature, bating some incoherent Parcels scatter'd up and down. Now my Intention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to contrive a Methodical Institution of <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal History,</hi> in which all the several Parts should be rank'd in due order without confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or obscurity; the great Obstacle I met with, was, that <hi>History</hi> lyes in a more wretch'd Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than any of its fellow Arts or Sciences, which are, almost all of 'em, improv'd to a due per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: notwithstanding that <hi>History</hi> comes short of none of 'em, whether we consider the Excellency or the Usefulness of its Subject.</p>
            <p>For I do not stand to assert, that there's no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant occurrence, relating to publick business or the adminstration of State-affairs, but what may be learn'd, and handsomely expedited, by the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of <hi>History;</hi> with as great ease, as our Lawyers do form their Judgments and Decisive Sentences upon all Suits, from precedents and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer decrees upon record. In <hi>History</hi> we'll meet with all that can occur in the Government of a State; with the Original Springs, the Progress and the event of things and the manner of going about them. 'Tis true the diversity of time and Place will sometimes occasion contrary Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but Prudence and Judgment will easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the difficulty, and reconcile the seeming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety. And History is so justly entitled to this
<pb facs="tcp:136207:5"/> perfection that <hi>Cominaeus</hi> do's not stand to assert, that wise Counsellors ought to admit of no Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, but what are either precedented, or at least approv'd and recommended by History.</p>
            <p>No Man can be a Stranger to the useful and necessary Offices that <hi>History</hi> do's to <hi>Theology,</hi> who do's but call to mind the different Opinions of different Times, and the infinity of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal heats that prevail'd both in the <hi>Synods</hi> and elsewhere. Now, who but a <hi>Historian</hi> should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint us with these things? And who else can furnish us with an account of those secular Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, which the Holy Pen-Men have glanc'd at by the bye?</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Civil Law, History</hi> is so serviceable upon that score, that whoever neglects it, may well be a Petty-fogger, but cannot merit the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of a <hi>Civilian.</hi> To this purpose are those words of the famous <hi>Gothofredus,</hi> viz. <hi>Since the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law (Jus Publicum) relates to the State of</hi> Rome, <hi>and that all its statutes are such as were occasion'd by the pinch of Circumstances and Times, and the temporary state of the Kingdom; how can any Man pretend to be throughly acqainted with the same, without carrying along with him, not only the General History of that Age, but, as Tertullian</hi> says, <hi>The particular Accounts of the minuter periods of time; without digging up and weighing the grounds and occasions of every Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute; and in a word, without distinguishing occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional Priviledges from standing Laws? Now the omission of that, has occasion'd those blunders that stand staring in the Comments upon the most solemn Constitutions relating to Common Law. This is the source of those hard and intricat Questions,
<pb facs="tcp:136207:5"/> that 'tis scarce possible to clear: this gave rise to the jarring sentiments of Lawyers which are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether irreconcileable, namely, that those Statutes which of themselves are truly ambulatory and only for a time, are put on the foot of a standing and perpetual Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, since this is the case of the <hi>Roman Law,</hi> That of the <hi>Law of Nations</hi> must be much more such; since it depends so much upon History, that some have justly styl'd it, <hi>Jus Historicum.</hi> For it goes upon the Customs and Consent of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which we are only given to understand by the Annals and Records of <hi>History. For,</hi> says <hi>Grotius, History has a double use with reference to this Law; for it furnishes us at once both with</hi> Examples <hi>and</hi> Judgments. Examples <hi>are so much the more Authentick, that the times and People which afford 'em are entituled to a good Character: Hence the Ancient</hi> Grecian <hi>and</hi> Roman <hi>Instances do justly claim a preference to others. Neither are we to slight the</hi> Decrees <hi>and</hi> Judgments <hi>upon Record, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially those which agree: for, as I intimated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, the</hi> Law <hi>of</hi> Nature <hi>fecthes some evidence from them, but that of</hi> Nations <hi>has no other proof.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly those who wrote upon the rights that are common to several Princes and Nations (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom <hi>Albericus Gentilis</hi> and <hi>Hugo Grotius</hi> stand highest in the Roll) laid down this resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to themselves, that almost all their advances shou'd be fetch'd from History, and be tried, and acquitted or condemn'd, by putting 'em to the test of the same. From whence they were justly call'd <hi>Historico-jure-periti,</hi> i. e. <hi>Historical Lawyers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I am loth to tyre the Reader with an use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less heap of Words upon so clear a point. The
<pb facs="tcp:136207:6"/> same is the case of the <hi>Canon Law,</hi> the Law of Arms, and indeed of all <hi>Municipal Laws:</hi> I mean, that there's a necessity of explaining and illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them by the State of times, the Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of things, the Customs of Nations, and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other things that are only to be met with in Annals and Histories.</p>
            <p>These Considerations egg'd me on to reduce History into such a form, as might resemble that of a compleat Art or Science, and prove inviting to young Students. I first began to pick up the scatter'd parcels of the Ancient Empires and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, like so many floating planks after a Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack, and patch 'em up into one Body; and to trace the continued Series of things from their first source to the last periods, without omitting any thing of Importance. And always carried this view along with me, not only to trace the Progress of Commotions and Revolutions, but to lay open the Counsels, Reasons, and Methods of carrying them on; which to my mind are justly entituled the <hi>first fruits of History.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But after I had finish'd my Collection, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster'd up what I thought was wanting in other General Historians; I had a further concern upon me; namely, to pitch upon such a method and disposition of the whole, as would keep up the entire Schemes of Empires, Kingdoms and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicks, and at the same time lay them so toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as to observe the Unity of Time in Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary things, tho' widely different in their own Natures, and with reference to the places upon which they were acted. Sometimes I pitch'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one, and sometimes upon another method; what I lik'd but now, displeas'd me by and by;
<pb facs="tcp:136207:6"/>
'twas no sooner finish'd but I presently dash'd it out. At length, having weigh'd all objections in an even and just Ballance, I concluded upon the Method of carrying down the Contemporary's in parallel Chapters to those of the Monarchies.</p>
            <p>For in regard that History ought to be form'd into a Body, and the Affairs related ought to have a due connexion with one another; I thought it most proper to prefer the greater to the lesser, and to make the former a Standard for the order and method of the latter. Besides, every Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy may be look'd upon as a Head, by whose discretion and beck the better part of the World was govern'd in the respective Times. But more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, I have not only added the Contemporaries to each Monarchy, but have all along annex'd the more noted periods of Time and marks for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, so that the Young Student may all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long see, not only in what Year of such and such a Monarchy any memorable thing was acted, but likewise in what Year of the World, of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympiads, of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of the other <hi>Aera</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>By this Method any Man may read the entire History of any Monarchy, Kingdom, or Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, by its self, without confusion or interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And at the same time the Computation of Time is as clear and undisturb'd, as if all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Kingdoms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were mingl'd together in the usual Form. I have spent a great deal of pains in adding the History of the <hi>Hero</hi>'s; by reason that if Young Students do not apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the Knowledge of these tho' never so obscure, and even of the Fables, they never will be Masters of <hi>Universal History,</hi> nor be duly qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify'd
<pb facs="tcp:136207:7"/> for reading Authors and hearing the Lectures of the Learn'd.</p>
            <p>Neither have I omitted the Politick Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Forms of Governments, which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite in this Scheme. Sometimes I act the part of a Critick, and sometimes that of a Politician. But I never am overborn with Conceit or puff'd up with Pride; I am not so Arrogant and Proud of my own Brains, as to take Pleasure in hearing my self arraign others of Ignorance, Weakness and Mistakes.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, I would fain bespeak a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Construction of my Reader, and beg of him that he would rather consider the design and good meaning, than be scrupulously nice upon the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the performance. I am very sensible of my own Weakness, neither do I pretend to great things. I am sensible that whoever strikes out a new Method for things, lyes under many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and drudges so under the weight of the things themselves, that he has not leisure to mind the Elegancy of Speech. Who can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect perfection in a first Essay? I shou'd not be asham'd to acknowledge, that some things are here wanting which might easily be added, and that I was so much taken up with the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that I did not much mind the dress of my Words.</p>
            <p>But, let it be as it will, the Dye's thrown. And thus stands the first Part of my <hi>Institution of History;</hi> to which a second Part will be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as soon as the weight and bulk of so great an undertaking, and the Author's private Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances will permit. That will be a Work of infinite Reading; a great many Books must
<pb facs="tcp:136207:7"/> be read over and over again, many must be consulted, several collated and compar'd, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to clear up the Truth of things, lay open the particular Constitutions and Forms of Church and State Government in all Nations, and present the world with a view of the Affairs transacted in 'em. And after all, 'twill be as difficult a task to Methodise the Work, and avoid the wonted Confusion. But what infinite Sums of Money must be laid out in purchasing Books, for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of this Work! And what expence of time must a Man be at in perusing 'em? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, to speak modestly, the undertaker ought to be a rich Man.</p>
            <p>Some were of Opinion that it would be a Piece of Service done both to my Countrymen and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, to publish this Epitome of the first part, in Latin; while the other was getting ready. Should I tell the Reader, that 'twas in comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with their requests and repeated advice that I publish'd it, I should tell nothing but truth. However 'tis impossible to talk a reader into the belief of such a Story, or to manage it so dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terously as to avoid the Imputation of the same ridiculousness and impertinency, that is commonly charg'd upon vulgar Authors. I shall therefore only add, that those who lik'd the Method of my <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,</hi> cannot dislike these <hi>Elements;</hi> or deny that they are seasonably calculated for young Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents; to the end, that, by learning these by Heart, they may be conducted more easily and methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally to a fuller knowledge of things, and be led as 'twere by the hand from the General Heads of Affairs to the compleater and circumstantial ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the same. I have favour'd their Study
<pb facs="tcp:136207:8"/> by a succinct and perspicuous Brevity, that so the Heads may be better lodg'd in their Memories. And in regard that <hi>Sleidan</hi> is perus'd by most of 'em, I have pick'd out the best of the few beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful stroaks, which that Author has confusedly huddled up in his book of the four Monarchies; and transplanted 'em into this book with all due Caution. To conclude; I thought it needless to cram these narrow Pages with Quotations, to vouch for what I advance, since my <hi>Institution of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story</hi> is plentifully stor'd with such upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions.</p>
            <p>'Tis now seven or eight Years, since I put this Book into Latin, and digested it in its due Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, being then in <hi>France,</hi> where the want of Books and the other Inconveniencies that attend travelling, hinder'd me both from carrying on the second part of my <hi>Institution,</hi> and from beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying these Elements in proportion to my own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign and the Nature of the subject. After that, it lay by in my Closet, and was like to be wasted by time, for the putting off of which it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil'd; till at last upon a certain pressing occasion it was snatch'd out of my Hands, and now pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd, I wish in a good time.</p>
            <p>My last request of the Candid Reader, is, that he would chiefly mind the Scheme and Design of the Work. Upon that score I hope it will not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please him, tho' I cannot say that I am yet very fond of it.</p>

               <p n="1">1. IN the beginning God created Heaven and Earth: At last on the Sixth Day he created Man, having made all suitable Preparations, for the intertainment of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant of the World.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Adam</hi> was thus left in a state of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: But he quickly forfeited both his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and felicity by eating the forbidden Fruit: And involv'd all his Posterity both in the Guilt and the Punishment. Having committed so hain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Crime, he was expell'd Paradise, and doom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Manure the Earth. By his Wife <hi>Eve</hi> he had
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:136207:13"/> two Sons, namely, <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel:</hi> The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, in resentment of God's Preferring his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Sacrifice, kill'd the latter. At last <hi>Adam</hi> in the 130th Year of his Age, begot <hi>Seth,</hi> and liv'd in all 930 Years.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Cain</hi>'s Posterity being swept off by a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge; the Church of God, and the Race of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, was propagated by <hi>Seth:</hi> Who, in the 105th Year of his Age begat <hi>Enos; Enos</hi> in the 90th begat <hi>Cainan; Cainan</hi> in the 70th be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat <hi>Mahaleel; Mahaleel</hi> in the 65th begat <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; Jared</hi> in the 162 begat <hi>Enoch; Enoch</hi> in the 65th begat <hi>Methuselah; Methuselah</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved 969 Years, which was longer than any Mortal Man did; in the 187th Year of his Age he begat <hi>Lamech;</hi> and <hi>Lamech</hi> in the 182 begot <hi>Noah;</hi> who, after he had liv'd 600 Years, made an Ark, pursuant to God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, by which he sav'd himself and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, when the rest of Mankind perish'd in a Deluge. This Deluge happen'd in the Year of the World 1656.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Noah</hi> had three Sons, <hi>Shem, Ham,</hi> and <hi>Japhet;</hi> who repair'd the loss of Mankind, and furnish'd the Earth with new Inhabitants. <hi>Shem</hi> possess'd part of <hi>Asia. Japhet</hi> was Master of all <hi>Europe,</hi> besides <hi>Asia</hi> the lesser, <hi>Media,</hi> part of <hi>Armenia, Iberia, Albania,</hi> and those vast Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries Inhabited formerly by the <hi>Scythians,</hi> and now by the <hi>Tartars.</hi> Not to speak of <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> which, it is probable, the <hi>Scythians</hi> reach'd through the straits of <hi>Anian; Japhet</hi>'s Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity had a right to those Northern Countries, which <hi>Jornan</hi> justly styles a Warehouse of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and a sheath of People. <hi>Ham</hi> the Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est

               <head type="sub">Reaching from the first Rise of the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Empire to its downfal.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THE Earth being thus divided, <hi>Nimrod</hi> the Son of <hi>Cush,</hi> and Grandchild to <hi>Cham</hi> took up his seat at <hi>Babel,</hi> where he first begun to Reign, having added to his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions <hi>Erech, Accad,</hi> and <hi>Calneb</hi> in the Land of <hi>Sinaar.</hi> 'Twas he that projected the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that prodigious Tower, which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented so much, that he punish'd Mankind with a Confusion of Languages: Whence that Monument of Madness was styl'd <hi>Babel.</hi> This was the true <hi>Belus</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> whom <hi>Moses</hi> represents as a great Hunter; whereupon some imagine he got his Kingdom by Hunting, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving drawn together a number of Men to make head against the Wild Beasts that infested the Land. He Reign'd 63 Years.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Ninus</hi> his Son and Successor, Worshipp'd his Father as a God, and so prov'd the first Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Idolatry. He enter'd into a League with the King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> and with joint For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces subdu'd <hi>Armenia</hi> and <hi>Media,</hi> and in the space of 17 Years Conquer'd all <hi>Asia,</hi> besides the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Bactrians;</hi> the latter of whom he at length defeated, notwithstanding the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:136207:14"/> of their King <hi>Zoroaster,</hi> or rather <hi>Oxyar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</hi> Having Reign'd 52 Years he died, either before some Town as being wounded with a Dart, or else through the Treachery of his Wife <hi>Semiramis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Ninias</hi> or <hi>Ninus</hi> his Son being then a Youth, <hi>Semiramis</hi> the Mother put on a Mans Habit, and Reign'd in his room. She rebuilt, inlarg'd and fortified <hi>Babylon,</hi> and being not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the Dominions of <hi>Ninus,</hi> added <hi>Ethiopia</hi> to them, and made War in <hi>India.</hi> In Riches, Victories and Triumphs, she was Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to none. After 42 Years her Son kill'd her, either out of an itch to Govern, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject her Embraces.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Ninias</hi> degenerated from the Example of his Ancestors, and gave himself to Luxury and Idleness: Tho' at the same time the Art of Ranking and putting Soldiers in Order is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to him; which all the Succeeding Princes down to the fall of the Empire, did mightily esteem. Of thirty Successors, most of 'em fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd his Example, and none of 'em did any Memorable thing, bating <hi>Teutamus</hi> who sent Auxiliary Troops to <hi>Priamus</hi> when Besieg'd by the <hi>Grecians;</hi> and the last of that Line, who render'd himself famous by his Luxury and the manner of his Death, being styl'd <hi>Tonos-conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leros</hi> by his own People, and by the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans Sardanapalus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. He was the most effeminate Man upon Earth. He liv'd among Women in eternal Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and medled with nothing but the Distaff and the Wool. He was so much dedicated to his Pleasures, that he seldom appear'd abroad.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:136207:14"/> By these means two of his Governours, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Belochus</hi> Governour of <hi>Babylonia,</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baces</hi> Governour of the <hi>Medes,</hi> were dissaffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and combin'd to expose the soft and filthy Conduct of his Life, and Declare War against him. The King having early notice of their Revolt, made preparations for a Defence, and obtain'd three Victories over the Rebels. By this Success he became secure, and return'd to his Pleasures: Which animated the Rebels so, that they made the reprisal of an equal number of Victories over his Forces, and laid Seige to the Town.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> stood out against the Siege two Years, and perswaded himself he would be able to continue so to do, till relief came, because the Oracle had foretold, that <hi>Nineveh</hi> shou'd never be taken till the River wag'd War with the Town. But in the third Year of the Siege there fell so much Rain, and <hi>Euphrates</hi> swell'd so high, that it broke in over the Walls, and cover'd them for twenty Furlongs. This did so Thunder-strike <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> that he erected a Funeral Pile, and threw himself and his Riches into the Flames. This says one, was the only Manlike Action of his Life; it happen'd in the Year of the World 3186, 43 Years before the first <hi>Oympiad,</hi> and 1400 Years after the building of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. The <hi>Assyrian</hi> Empire did in a manner sink with <hi>Sardanapalus;</hi> being divided into two Principalities. For <hi>Arbaces</hi> was declar'd King by the Army, and pursuant to a mutual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact gave <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Belochus.</hi> Some say, <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baces</hi> laid <hi>Nineveh</hi> in Ashes; others think he

               <p n="8">8. One of these Principalities was the <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> which, it is probable, not only <hi>Arbaces,</hi> but his Posterity inherited. For tho' <hi>Herodotus</hi> Writes that the <hi>Medes</hi> shook off the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Yoke, and liv'd several Ages without a King: Yet <hi>Ctesias,</hi> who professes that he collected his History out of the <hi>Persian</hi> Annals, says that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baces</hi> having Reign'd 18 Years, was Succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Mandauces</hi> his Son, and he in order by <hi>Sesarmus, Artias, Arbianis, Arsaeus, Artynes, Artibarnes, and Astyages</hi> Grandfather to <hi>Cyrus</hi> by the Mother side. Besides, <hi>Eusebius</hi> in his Chronicle mentions the same Succession of Kings from <hi>Arbaces,</hi> tho' he differs from <hi>Ctesias</hi> as to the Names of the Princes.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The other Government was that of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> headed by <hi>Belochus.</hi> 'Tis uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain how long he Reign'd, or who Succeeded him. After, 71 Years, <hi>Nabonasar</hi> obtain'd the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Kingdom, the beginning of whose Reign, in the 8 <hi>Olympiad,</hi> gave Date to that famous <hi>Aera</hi> of <hi>Nabonasar,</hi> commencing from the first Day of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Month <hi>Thoth</hi> (Feb. 26) about 746 Years and 310 Days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Christian Period according to some Calculations, and 424 Years before the Death of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Nine Kings Succeeded <hi>Arbaces</hi> in order; and then follow'd an <hi>interregnum</hi> of Eight
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:136207:15"/> Years: At which time it seems the Royal Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring fail'd, and <hi>Escarchaddon,</hi> King of <hi>Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> subdued the <hi>Babylonians.</hi> For he who Govern'd the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> by <hi>Ptolomy</hi> is call'd <hi>Assaradinus,</hi> which Name seems to have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther difference from <hi>Escarchaddon,</hi> but what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises from the various accents of different Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages.</p>
               <p n="11">11. As touching the reviving of the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Monarchy; 'tis not at all probable, that after the Death of <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> eieher the whole Empire, or the greater part of it was Subject to <hi>Media</hi> and <hi>Babylon.</hi> On the contrary, it is most likely, that <hi>Arbaces,</hi> when he Govern'd the <hi>Medes,</hi> left several Countries to the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Liberty, whom he cou'd not bring to a tame compliance with his Yoke. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Nations lying beyond <hi>Euphrates,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sick of <hi>Anarchie</hi> and the infinite evils that arise therefrom, did not scruple to receive a Prince of a Forreign Descent, who was so far inferiour to the Successors of <hi>Belus</hi> in Dignity and the extent of his Empire, that the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> look'd upon <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> as the last <hi>Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> King.</p>
               <p n="12">12. We are not yet inform'd, who this first Prince was, or what was his Name.

Another confounds him with <hi>Tiglath-Pilesar,</hi> who, as he reckons, took upon him the Name of <hi>Ninus Junior.</hi> This Prince destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Kingdom of <hi>Damascus,</hi> and after 28
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:136207:16"/> Years left <hi>Salmanasar</hi> his Successor, who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the <hi>Israelites</hi> off in Captivity, and subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Phaenicia</hi> and <hi>Syria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>Salmanasar</hi> was follow'd by <hi>Sennache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib,</hi> who infested <hi>Egypt</hi> with Hostilities, and mightily pinch'd <hi>Hezekiah</hi> King of <hi>Judah:</hi> But his Blasphemies did so incense the Almighty, that, by the Hand of an Angel, he lost in one Night 185000 Men: Upon which he return'd Home, was kill'd by his Sons <hi>Adrameleh</hi> and <hi>Sharezer,</hi> and his Son <hi>Escarchaddon</hi> Succeeded him.</p>
               <p n="14">14. This Prince is taken to be the same with <hi>Assardinus</hi> mention'd by <hi>Ptolomy</hi> that famous Mathematician, in his List of the Kings.

               <p n="15">15. If we may credit the Book of <hi>Judith,</hi> that <hi>Nebuchadonosor</hi> who kill'd and defeated <hi>Arphaxad</hi> King of the <hi>Medes,</hi> and the Builder of <hi>Ecbatana,</hi> is the same with <hi>Saosducinus.</hi> This <hi>Arphaxad</hi> is the same with <hi>Deioces,</hi> whom <hi>Herodotus</hi> mentions as the Builder of that City

               <p n="16">16. <hi>Saosducinus</hi> was succeeded by <hi>Chynala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danus,</hi> who is call'd <hi>Saracus</hi> by <hi>Alexander Polyhistor. Phraertes</hi> King of the <hi>Medes</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of his Father's Death, declar'd War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him; but, tho' he subdu'd all <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Persia,</hi> was at length defeated: But his Son <hi>Cyaxares</hi> renewed the War, beat the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> and besieg'd the Town <hi>Ninus;</hi> but at that time the <hi>Scythians</hi> expell'd the <hi>Cimmerians</hi> out of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> and pursu'd them to <hi>Media,</hi> which oblig'd him to break up the Siege and return home: Where he was routed in a battel by the <hi>Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and lost the Empire of all <hi>Asia,</hi> which the others possess'd for 28 Years.</p>
               <p n="17">17. After 28 Years, the <hi>Scythians</hi> were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd to Security and Mal-administration: Upon which <hi>Cyaxares</hi> invited them to a Feast, and having made them drunk, stabb'd them: By this means he retrieved his former Dignity and Dominions. After that <hi>Nabopolassar,</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to the King of <hi>Assyria</hi>'s Army, made an alliance wirh <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> by marrying his Son <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezar</hi> to <hi>Amyte,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Astyages,</hi> the Son of <hi>Cyaxares.</hi> Being strengthn'd by this mutual Alliance, they jointly destroy'd <hi>Chinalada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> or <hi>Saracus,</hi> after he had reign'd 22 Years.</p>
               <p n="18">18.

                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:136207:17"/> and by the Rebellion of <hi>Caelo-Syria</hi> and <hi>Phaenicia,</hi> took in <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> his Son as Partner in the Government, and sent him at the Head of an Army against the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="19">19. <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> upon the way oblig'd <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hojakin</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> and subject to <hi>Neco,</hi> to be his Tributary. This incens'd the <hi>Egyptian</hi> King, so that he march'd against him, and in a second Engagement at <hi>Carcemissus,</hi> was routed and kill'd. While <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> pursu'd his Victory, and extended his Conquests from <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates</hi> to the <hi>Nile,</hi> his Father died at <hi>Babylon,</hi> and himself was seasonably recall'd by the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans,</hi> to establish his Crown.</p>
               <p n="20">20. This Prince beautified <hi>Babylon,</hi> added a new City to the old, and surrounded them both with three Walls. He caus'd the famous Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Garden to be made round the Palace, in order to present his Wife with a continual View and natural Scheme of <hi>Media,</hi> for she took plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in beholding the High-lands of her own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, 'Twas this <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> who besieg'd <hi>Jerusalem</hi> two Years, and laid it in Ashes; who pull'd down the Walls, and carried off the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the People in Captivity; who put out the Eyes of King <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> and kill'd his Children and Noble-men.</p>
               <p n="21">21. This Prince in a Dream, had presented to him the Image of a large Statue, with a Head of Gold, Breast and Arms of Silver, Belly and Thighs of Brass, Legs of Iron, and the Feet half Iron and half Clay. When he awaken'd he forgot his Dream, and threaten'd Death to the Wise Men if they did not tell him
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:136207:17"/> what it was: They were not capable to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer his Demands, but <hi>Daniel</hi> of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> by vertue of his Prayers, told him what he had dream'd, and having explain'd it, made a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of the four great Monarchies.</p>
               <p n="22">22. God punish'd his Pride, with a horrible Instance, which all Great Men, Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ought diligently to weigh and consider, in order to dispose themselves to revere the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majesty, and perform their Duty to the People committed to their Care. He was for the space of Seven Times, (which most Writers understand to be Seven Years) expell'd Humane Society, and doom'd to live among the Beasts: But after the set Period was over, he return'd to himself, and retriev'd his former Dignity and Government. <hi>Abydemus</hi> a Heathen, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions this Passage: <hi>Megasthenes, Diocles</hi> and <hi>Philostratus</hi> wrote upon the same Subject. He reign'd 43 Years, according to <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> who calls him <hi>Nabocolassar,</hi> or rather <hi>Nabocodolassar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="23">23. His Successor was <hi>Evilmerodach,</hi> a Man wrap'd up in wickedness and Debauchery, who after 2 Years was made away by the contrivance of <hi>Neriglissor</hi> his Brother-in-Law. <hi>Neriglissor</hi> reign'd 4 Years, and left his Son and Successor <hi>Laborosardock,</hi> who being an ill-natur'd Prince, was kill'd by his own People after nine Months. Then the Government came into the Hands of one <hi>Nabonydus</hi> a <hi>Babylonian,</hi> call'd by others <hi>Nabannidochus</hi> and <hi>Labynitus.</hi> When this Man had reign'd 17, or (as some will have it) 27 Years, he was kill'd by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who conquer'd <hi>Babylon,</hi> and transfer'd the Empire to the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians.</hi>

                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:136207:18"/>24. This series of Kings is convey'd to us by <hi>Berosus</hi> a <hi>Chaldean</hi> Historian, whom <hi>Josephus</hi> often quotes; and whom <hi>Ptolomy</hi> that famous <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Mathematician, backs with Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the same. 'Tis true, there have been some Learned Men, who thought that <hi>Daniel's</hi> History was against this order; but there are others equally learned, who have given satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory answers to all their Arguments: as it is made to appear in our Institutions of History. But now that we are come up with <hi>Cyrus,</hi> 'twill be requisite to describe, with all possible Brevity, who he was, of what Country, and what were the Qualities of a Man that was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to wield so large an Empire.</p>
               <p n="25">25. That he was the Son of <hi>Cambyses</hi> the <hi>Persian,</hi> by <hi>Mandane</hi> Daughter to <hi>Astyages</hi> King of <hi>Media,</hi> is agreed upon by all, bating only <hi>Ctesias,</hi> who asserts, that he was no way a Kin to <hi>Astyages.</hi> But there are various Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of <hi>Cambyses</hi> his Circumstances. <hi>Herodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> says, that he was a Man of a mean Birth and Fortune; and that <hi>Astyages</hi> gave his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to such an one, on purpose, because he had dream'd that her Offspring would rise so high, as to overthrow his Government. He adds fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that when the Infant was born, he was given to <hi>Harpagus</hi> to be made away: but he taking Compassion of the Child, entrusted the King's Shepherd with the Execution of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's Commands: And the Shepherd's Wife having lately brought forth a Dead Child, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded her Husband to bring home the Child he had laid out, and breed him up in the Room of his deceas'd Son.</p>
               <p n="26">
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:136207:18"/>26. But <hi>Xenophon</hi> in that incomparable Book of his, concerning the Instruction of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts, that <hi>Cambyses</hi> was truely King of the <hi>Persians;</hi> and that <hi>Cyrus</hi> was admirably well vers'd in all the parts of <hi>Persian</hi> Learning, which he mightily cries up. But he has not one Word of the Story related by <hi>Herodotus,</hi> namely, That he was bred up among the King's Shepherds, and when by his princely and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing Genius he came to be known to his Grandfather <hi>Astyages,</hi> he sent him away to <hi>Persia;</hi> and that <hi>Astyages,</hi> for a Punishment of <hi>Harpagus</hi> his negligence in executing his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, regal'd him at a Feast with his own Son's Flesh: in revenge whereof, <hi>Harpagus,</hi> after some time, push'd on <hi>Cyrus</hi> to make an Insurrection against <hi>Astyages,</hi> and outt him of his Kingdom.</p>
               <p n="27">27. For <hi>Xenophon</hi> relates that <hi>Cyaxares,</hi> Son to <hi>Astyages,</hi> having no Male Issue, gave his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Marriage to <hi>Cyrus</hi> the <hi>Persian</hi> his own Sister's Son; and that being incommoded by a War with the King of the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in <hi>Cyrus</hi> to his assistance; who in that jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture was made Emperor of the whole Army, and successfully acted his part, in taking <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and at last succeeding his Uncle, after he had subdued <hi>Craesus</hi> King of <hi>Lydia,</hi> and many others. <hi>Craesus</hi> is a considerable Actor in the History of these Times; and therefore 'twill be necessary to run over the History of the <hi>Lydian</hi> Kings.</p>
               <p n="28">28. Some Grecian Authors will have <hi>Lydia</hi> (or <hi>Maeonia</hi>) to be so call'd from <hi>Lydus</hi> the King, Son to <hi>Atys,</hi> and Brother to <hi>Tyrrhenus.</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:136207:19"/> But 'tis apparent that <hi>Lydia</hi> was so call'd from <hi>Lud</hi> the Son of <hi>Shem,</hi> mention'd by <hi>Moses;</hi> and <hi>Maeonia</hi> from the River <hi>Meander.</hi> When <hi>Lydus</hi>'s Issue fail'd, according to <hi>Herodotus,</hi> the <hi>Heraclidae</hi> reign'd there 505 Years thro' 22 Successions: till the time of <hi>Caudaules,</hi> who was so proud of his Wife's Handsomeness, that he oblig'd <hi>Gyges</hi> his Servant to view her when naked. When the Queen knew this, she took it so ill, that she gave <hi>Gyges</hi> his Choice, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would die himself, or kill the King: by this means she push'd on her Servant to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricide, and afterwards married him.</p>
               <p n="29">29. Thus <hi>Gyges</hi> of a Servant became a King, conquer'd his Enemies by the Favorable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponse of the <hi>Delphick</hi> Oracle, subdued <hi>Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,</hi> made War with <hi>Miletus</hi> and <hi>Smyrna,</hi> establish'd and continued his Government 38 Years. <hi>Ardys</hi> his Son and Successor took <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ene,</hi> and besieg'd <hi>Miletus.</hi> In his time the <hi>Scythians</hi> drove the <hi>Cimmerians</hi> from their Seats, carried their Arms into <hi>Asia,</hi> and took <hi>Sardes,</hi> but did not carry the Castle. After 49 Years <hi>Sadyattes</hi> his Son succeeded: and he, after 12 Years, was follow'd by <hi>Alyattes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="30">30. <hi>Alyattes</hi> made War with <hi>Cyaxares</hi> the <hi>Mede,</hi> and expell'd the <hi>Cimmerians</hi> out of <hi>Asia.</hi> While he lay before <hi>Miletus,</hi> and had almost starv'd them out, they expos'd all the Corn, they had left, in the Publick Market-place; whereupon he, fancying they had more Provision than he was aware of, raiss'd the Siege, and concluded a Peace with 'em. He reign'd 57 Years, and then <hi>Craesus</hi> his Son, aged 35 Years, succeeded him.</p>
               <p n="31">
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:136207:19"/>31. <hi>Craesus</hi> subdued all the People of <hi>Asia</hi> on this side the River <hi>Halys:</hi> And rais'd to himself a great Fame by his glorious Achieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and infinite Plenty of all good things. Among the wise <hi>Grecians</hi> that crowded to <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, Solon</hi> of <hi>Athens</hi> came likewise to visit the King. At first he met with a very welcome reception; but when the King and he came to Discourse of Happiness, he would not own that the King was Happy, but gave out all worldly things for uncertainties; whereupon he was dismiss'd as an indiscreet and unequal Judge of things. However <hi>Craesus,</hi> who was so much puffed up, that he thought himself the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of Men, was of a sudden Mortified with the Death of his Eldest Son: Which was so much the more cutting, that his Brother who Succeeded him was Dumb. After he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plor'd the Fate of his Son for two Years, he was touch'd with the Envy of <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s Prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the heat whereof flew up into so great a flame, that all his Pride and Luxury vanish'd in Smoak, and he himself did but hardly escape the being burnt alive.</p>
               <p n="32">32. For, being deceiv'd by his Oracles, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> under the pretence of having satisfaction of <hi>Cyrus</hi> for the injury he did to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>styages</hi> his Sister's Husband; tho' at the bottom his design was to add that Fertile Country to his own Dominions. <hi>Cyrus</hi> March'd out to meet him with a greater Number of Forces, and tho' they fought with equal Success, yet <hi>Craesus</hi>'s Officers blam'd him for offering to Engage with an unequal Number of Men. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the next Day, <hi>Cyrus</hi> not coming on to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:136207:20"/> him Battel, he retir'd to <hi>Sardes,</hi> designing to wait the Arrival of Auxiliary Troops from his Allies, in order to attack the <hi>Persian</hi> next Spring with joint Forces.</p>
               <p n="33">33. <hi>Craesus</hi> thinking himself safe from his Enemy, because he had rendred him secure by his Retreat, dismiss'd his Mercenary Troops: When <hi>Cyrus</hi> receiv'd Advice of that, he thought he had a fair opportunity of bringing his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs to bear, and March'd with full speed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, in order to surprize him. <hi>Craesus</hi> made what haste he could in preparing for a Defence; but having march'd out of the Town, was routed, and then besieg'd. On the 14th Day of the Siege <hi>Sardes</hi> was carried, and he was taken Prisoner.</p>
               <p n="34">34. He was sentenc'd to be burnt: And when he mounted the Pile, cried out thrice, <hi>Solon.</hi> Being desir'd to give the Reason of this Outcry, he related the Story of his Interview with <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and <hi>Solon's</hi> Assertion, <hi>viz. That before Death, no Man should be accounted happy. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> taking this saying into his serious Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, bethought himself that he was likwise liable to the Jolts of Fortune; and therefore made a more moderat use of his Victory; and, having pardon'd <hi>Craesus,</hi> us'd him as his Friend and Kinsman. This happen'd in the 4th Year of the 58th <hi>Olympiad,</hi> the 15th Year of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> A. M. 3460.</p>
               <p n="35">35. <hi>Cyrus</hi> design'd to march against the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians, Bactrians, Saccae,</hi> and <hi>Egyptians.</hi> He employ'd <hi>Harpagus</hi> the <hi>Mede</hi> to subdue <hi>Lesser Asia;</hi> which accordingly he did; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise conquer'd the <hi>Ionians, Carians, Caunians,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:136207:20"/> Lycians,</hi> and several other Nations. Having subdued all the remaining part of the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, he march'd against the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> who had heap'd up great Magazines of Provisions, and retir'd within the Walls of <hi>Babylon.</hi> At first <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bynitus</hi> their King drew out his Troops, but he was routed, and oblig'd to return to the Town, which the other besieg'd.

The second was <hi>Nachor,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Chesed,</hi> or <hi>Phased:</hi> So that <hi>Abram</hi> was the Youngest, who seems to be born in the 130th, and not in the 70th Year of his Father, according to St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Discourse of the Ages of <hi>Terah</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> when the one dyed, and the other departed from <hi>Haran.</hi> A.M. 2008.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Abram,</hi> about the 70th year of his Age, was order'd to remove into the Land of the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:136207:21"/>
                        <hi>Canaanites,</hi> God having promis'd to him that his Family shou'd become a great Nation, and that all the Nations of the World should be blessed in him. He, pursuant to the command, went with his Father, <hi>Lot,</hi> and his Wife, from <hi>Ur</hi> of the <hi>Chaldees</hi> into <hi>Haran,</hi> and dwelt there. It seems he spent Five years at that place, out of tenderness to his Ancient and Sickly Father: And when the old Man departed this Life, set forward on his Journey to <hi>Canaan,</hi> in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Divine Precept. So that the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of <hi>Abram,</hi> and his Posterity's sojourning in a strange Land, is to be measur'd by 430 years.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. He sat first down in <hi>Sichem,</hi> where God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed the former promise, with an additional one of giving the Land to his Seed: And in this place <hi>Abram</hi> built the first Altar to the <hi>Lord.</hi> In the 11th year after his Entry into <hi>Canaan,</hi> he had a Son call'd <hi>Ismael</hi> by <hi>Hagar</hi> his Maid: And 15 years after that, God made a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him about <hi>Isaac,</hi> that was to be born as next year; and Instituted Circumcision as a Token of the Covenant. At that time his Name was chang'd from <hi>Abram</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as being not only a <hi>high and mighty Father,</hi> but <hi>a Father of many Nations. Sarai</hi> likewise his Wife, whose Name signified only <hi>my Mistress,</hi> as if it related only to one Family, was call'd <hi>Sarah,</hi> that is, <hi>an absolute Mistress,</hi> or <hi>one of many Nations.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. In the same Year God discover'd to <hi>Abraham</hi> his Decree of destroying <hi>Sodom,</hi> and the other Cities; and he not being able to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify the Divine Wrath, a Fire came down from Heaven that set the Cities in a Flame, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:136207:22"/>
                        <hi>Lot</hi> was saved. The Ground on which they stood became a dead Sea 70000 Paces wide: In which no Creature lives, neither doth it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford any thing but a sort of slimy Pitch for the use of Seamen; so that the Heathens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves have heard by Report, That in the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Times this Countrey was blasted from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife, going out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing behind her was turn'd into a Pillar of Salt; which <hi>Josephus</hi> says was standing in his time. <hi>Lot</hi>'s Two Daughters fancying that the whole Race of Mankind was destroy'd, made their Father drunk, and embrac'd him: And from these incestuous Embraces sprung <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Ammon,</hi> Two Patriarchs of as many powerful Nations.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. When the time was expir'd, according to the Tenour of God's promise, <hi>Isaac</hi> was born in the 100th year of his Father, and the 90th of his Mother, 400 before the return of the <hi>Israelites</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> 37 years after <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> dyed. Then <hi>Abraham</hi> married <hi>Keturah,</hi> and had Issue by her, which he regal'd with Gifts, and sent away before he dyed. When <hi>Isaac</hi> was 40 years old, he gave him in Marriage <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bekah,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Bethuel,</hi> Son to <hi>Nachor</hi> his Brother: And she after Twenty years barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness brought forth Twins; namely <hi>Esau</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. At length after 15 years <hi>Abraham,</hi> God's Darling, gave up the Ghost in the 175th year of his Age; 100 years after his arrival in <hi>Canaan,</hi> 25 years after the Death of <hi>Shem,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Inachus</hi> in <hi>Greece,</hi> 1821 years before the Birth of Christ, in the year of the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:136207:22"/> World 2183. <hi>Artapanus, Charax, Berosus, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cataeus,</hi> and <hi>Nicolaus Damascenus,</hi> who were all Heathen Writers, make mention of him.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>Abraham</hi> being dead, God blessed <hi>Isaac,</hi> and made a Covenant with him, 48 years after <hi>Ismael</hi> dyed, in the 137 year of his Age, A.M. 2231. From <hi>Nabaioth</hi> his Eldest Son sprung the <hi>Nabatheans,</hi> who inhabited a part of <hi>Arabia,</hi> call'd <hi>Petraea,</hi> from <hi>Petra</hi> the Metropolitan. Among them 'twas reckon'd a crime to Sow or to Plant, to drink Wine or to build Houses: They were fond of their liberty, and lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these things as the Incentives of Ambition. <hi>Kedar Ismael</hi>'s t'other Son gave likewise the Name to a part of <hi>Arabia,</hi> that's frequently mention'd in Scripture. Tho' the <hi>Cushites, Midianites,</hi> and <hi>Ismaelites</hi> were not of the same Original; yet since they liv'd together, it seems they grew together into one Nation of the <hi>Saracens.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9. 15 years after this, <hi>Isaac</hi> being then blind, and in the 138th year of his Age, sent his Eldest Son <hi>Esau</hi> a Hunting, to the end that he might feed upon Venison, and then bless him. But <hi>Jacob</hi> by his Mother's cunning per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonated him; and having already bought the Birthright for a Mess of Pottage, chous'd him of the blessing. His Brother was so incensed at this, that <hi>Jacob</hi> was forc'd to flee into <hi>Mesopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamia</hi> to <hi>Laban</hi> his Uncle, whose two Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters he married, having purchas'd 'em for 14 years service.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. By these two Women, and as many Handmaids, he had Twelve Sons, and One Daughter. After 20 years hard service he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:136207:23"/> from <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> into <hi>Canaan.</hi> While he liv'd there, <hi>Joseph</hi> his Son was sold by his envious Brethren to <hi>Midianite</hi> Merchants, and carried into <hi>Egypt</hi> in the 17th year of his Age, and 109th of his Father. In <hi>Egypt</hi> he serv'd <hi>Potiphar</hi> Governor to <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Houshold, and was made Overseer of his Family. After he had serv'd him 16 years, his Mistress sollicited him to uncleanness, which he refus'd, and was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon charg'd with the same Crime, and cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Prison.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. About this time his Grandfather <hi>Isaac</hi> dyed, and was buried by <hi>Esau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> his Sons; of whom the former was reconcil'd to his Brother; and having made an equal divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of their Goods, return'd to Mount <hi>Seir;</hi> God having so order'd it, that hereafter when the <hi>Israelites</hi> should come to repossess <hi>Canaan,</hi> his Posterity shou'd not be thrown out of their Possessions. He was likewise call'd <hi>Edom,</hi> and from thence the Country was stil'd <hi>Idumea,</hi> and under that Name the Country of the <hi>Naba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theans</hi> seems to be included. For it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, That he who married <hi>Nabaioth</hi>'s Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, join'd in with them, and headed them. And this is that famous Hero, who Christen'd not only <hi>Idumea,</hi> but likewise the <hi>Erythrean, Idumean,</hi> or <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> all which signify the same thing; for <hi>Erythraeum</hi> among the <hi>Grecians</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the same as <hi>Edom</hi> in the primitive Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. While <hi>Joseph</hi> continu'd in Prison, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted the Dreams of two Courtiers, and the event justified his interpretation; whereupon after Two years Imprisonment, the King call'd
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:136207:23"/> for him, his own Wise men having fail'd in the interpretation of his Dreams. As his Dreams implied the Succession of 7 years of Plenty, and as many of Famine; so <hi>Joseph</hi> gave him such seasonable advice for laying up Provisions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the approaching Famine, that the King perceiv'd it surmounted the pitch of humane strength, and thereupon advanc'd him to the highest Dignity in the Kingdom, giving him in Marriage <hi>Asenatha,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Potiphar,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of <hi>On,</hi> or <hi>Heliopolis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="13">13. The Famine did not only over-run <hi>Egypt,</hi> but also reach'd the Neighbouring places of <hi>Canaan</hi> and <hi>Arabia:</hi> So that <hi>Jacob</hi> being pinch'd by it, sent his Sons to buy Provisions; where being discover'd by <hi>Joseph</hi> their Brother in disguise, they were cunningly charg'd with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spies. But when they came a second time he releas'd <hi>Simeon</hi> whom he had kept as an Hostage, and discover'd himself to them. They were cast down, as being conscious of their former Wickedness, but he encourag'd them, and furnished them with all neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Provisions, and sent them to bring up their Father, and his whole Family, with all speed. <hi>Jacob</hi> was animated by his Son's Safety and good Fortune, whose imaginary Death he had long lamented; and being encourag'd from Heaven, went cheerfully down to <hi>Egypt,</hi> in the 130th year of his Age, and the Third year of the Famine, in the 2298th year of the World.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. He liv'd 17 years in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted <hi>Joseph</hi>'s Two Sons, preferring the Younger to the Elder; and having call'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and bless'd his Children, gave up the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:136207:24"/> Ghost. In <hi>Egypt</hi> his death was lamented 70 or 72 days: Then he was carried into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and after the Observation of 7 days more of Mourning, was buried by his Sons, attended by a great Number of Courtiers and Princes. <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi>'s Brethren deprecating his Wrath, were pardon'd by him, and freely provided with all Necessaries.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. At length, having govern'd <hi>Egypt</hi> under several Kings for 80 years, having liv'd 110 years, and survived his Father 50, he ended his days. <hi>Trogus Pompeius</hi> wrote several things of him, as it appears from <hi>Justin;</hi> which are partly taken from sacred History, and partly deriv'd from the Fables, which the Heathens, pursuant to their Custom, invented of the <hi>Jews.</hi> The period of <hi>Joseph</hi>'s Life, concludes the Book of <hi>Genesis,</hi> which contains an account of the Affairs of 2369 years. The next to that seems to be the Book of <hi>Job,</hi> which the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> always attributed to <hi>Moses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="16">16. <hi>Joseph</hi> and his Contemporaries being all dead, the number of the <hi>Israelites</hi> increas'd every day so much, and became so great, that the King being apprehensive of the consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, concerted measures to impair it. First, he order'd the Midwives to make away all the Male-children; and when that Project did not take, issued out an Edict for drowning them. About this time was born <hi>Moses</hi> Son to <hi>Amram,</hi> and <hi>Jocabed,</hi> and after three Months, when he cou'd not be hid no longer, was laid by the brink of a River in an Ark of Bulrushes daub'd with Slime and Pitch. <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Daughter call'd by <hi>Josephus, Thermutis,</hi> finding the Child
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:136207:24"/> there, put him out to be Nurs'd by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom she did not know to be such: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards she adopted him for her Son, and took care to see him instructed in all the Wisdom of the <hi>Egyptians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="17">17. When <hi>Moses</hi> grew up, through Faith he refus'd to be call'd <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Grandchild, and after the 40th year of his Age, visited his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and took their Burthen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his consideration; upon which occasion he kill'd an <hi>Egyptian</hi> for striking a <hi>Hebrew.</hi> When <hi>Pharaoh</hi> heard this, he sought for him in order to punish him by Death: Whereupon he fled into the Land of the <hi>Midianites,</hi> and was kindly entertain'd by <hi>Hobab</hi> or <hi>Jethro,</hi> whose Daughter <hi>Zipporah</hi> he married, and stayed there 40 years.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. When the 40 years were expir'd, as he was feeding the Sheep, he was call'd by God, and sent to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> to rescue the <hi>Israelites</hi> from their insupportable Bondage. But the Embassy took no Effect; nay on the contrary harder la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour was enjoin'd the <hi>Israelites,</hi> over and above their daily Task. Whereupon after many Signs, God, by <hi>Moses</hi>'s Ministry, afflicted the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> with Ten Plagues; Nine of which made little impression upon the King; but the Tenth, namely the Slaughter of all the First-born con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd him to dismiss the <hi>Israelites.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. THere went out of <hi>Egypt</hi> 600000 <hi>Israelites</hi> Twenty years old and upwards, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides Women and Children. According to this computation the total Sum of persons of all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges will amount to 1500000, if we follow the common Calculation of all Nations. And the mixt multitude that accompany'd them seems to equal the number above-mention'd. 'Tis ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that 70 persons might naturally multiply into so large a Number, as I made it out in my Institutions.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Moses</hi> gather'd the People at <hi>Rameses,</hi> from whence they mov'd and took up their second Station at <hi>Succoth.</hi> From thence they pass'd to <hi>Etha,</hi> and at length to <hi>Pihahiroth,</hi> whither <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> pursued them; and God dividing the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Red Sea, to make way for their Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage into the Desert, suffer'd <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to be over-run by the returning Waves. <hi>Josephus</hi> lessens the Credit of this Miracle; thinking to gain Credit from the Heathens, by comparing it to <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Passage thro' the Bay of <hi>Pamphylia:</hi> Whereas <hi>Strabo</hi> tells us, that when the Sea ebbs, this Bay is quite dry; and even when the highest Tyde comes in, 'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so deep as to be impassable.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Israelites spent a year and a half in the Desert, to the end that their Spirits being
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:136207:25"/> broke and debas'd by Bondage, might rise by degrees to the pursuit of Military and Civil Affairs. In this Interval of time, their <hi>Moral, Judicial,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Laws were enacted by God himself, their Tabernacle was erected, and the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> or a Court of 70 Judges, was instituted. In the 5th Month of the 2 Year, they sent Twelve Spyes, that is, a Man for every Tribe, to view the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> When they return'd, ten of 'em gave an ill Character of the Countrey, and cry'd up the strength of the Towns and Inhabitants so much, that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were scar'd from pursuing the Enterprise, and offer'd to return to <hi>Egypt,</hi> and to stone <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shuah</hi> and <hi>Caleb</hi> to Death, who were the Two Spyes that differ'd from the other Ten.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. God threaten'd these Rebels with sudden Destruction: and tho' by vertue of <hi>Moses</hi>'s Prayers he was influenc'd to delay it for a time, yet he sentenc'd all above Twenty Years, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Joshuah</hi> and <hi>Caleb,</hi> to die in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and the whole Body to wander there 40 Years. Accordingly, the Ten Spyes were taken off by sudden Death, the Memory of which Judgment is to this day celebrated by the <hi>Jews</hi> by a Fast on the Seventh Day of the Sixth Month <hi>Elul.</hi> The surviving number, when they were just upon the Borders of <hi>Canaan,</hi> were order'd to return towards the <hi>Red Sea;</hi> but marching up the Mountain contrary to God's Commands were routed by the <hi>Amalekites</hi> and <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and weep'd in vain before God.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Upon the occasion of this Disaster, and the continual and daily Death of the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the Wilderness, <hi>Moses</hi> compil'd the 90th
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:136207:26"/> Psalm, in which he implies, that the Life of Man is confin'd within the Compass of 70 or 80 Years. Which was the third time that Man's Life was shorten'd by one half; the same having happen'd for the first time immediately after the Deluge, and a second time in the Days of <hi>Phaleg,,</hi> when the Earth was divided.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Moses</hi> gives but a small account of what happen'd in the succeeding 38 Years; but in the 40th Year he tells us the Kings of the <hi>Aradites</hi> and <hi>Amorites</hi> were defeated. Pursuant to God's Denunciation, all that were fit for War died in the Wilderness. Whereupon <hi>Moses</hi> was order'd to number the People a third time, and found there was 61173, aged twenty Years and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, besides 23000 Levites including all above one Month old, so that the number of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren almost equal'd that of the Parents.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. At last the <hi>Midianites</hi> were conquer'd, and the Countries of <hi>Zihon</hi> King of the <hi>Amorites,</hi> and <hi>Og</hi> King of <hi>Bashan,</hi> were divided among the Children of <hi>Reuben</hi> and <hi>Gad,</hi> and half the Tribe of <hi>Manasseh.</hi> And then <hi>Moses</hi> died, aged 120 Years, five Months after the Death of his Brother <hi>Aaron.</hi> He spent one third of his Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in the Administration of Affairs, since the 40th Year of his Age was just expir'd, when he conducted the People out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> A.

After the Death of <hi>Moses, Joshua,</hi> or <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Nun,</hi> govern'd the People, and conducted them into <hi>Canaan,</hi> on the 10th Day of the first Month <hi>Nisan.</hi> When <hi>Joshua</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su'd
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:136207:26"/> his Enemies, the Sun and Moon stood still one whole Day, to favour the Pursuit. No City made Peace with the <hi>Israelites,</hi> excepting the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> who over-reach'd them; but they were all destroy'd, bateing a few, whom God reserv'd to be imploy'd in future times, to punish his Rebellious People.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The <hi>Canaanites</hi> being dispossess'd of their Country repair to the Sea-side, where they were afterwards Christen'd <hi>Phaenicians;</hi> they planted Colonies in several parts of <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> and particularly, in <hi>Fez</hi> and <hi>Morocco,</hi> where they rear'd up Pillars, with Inscriptions in <hi>Phaenician</hi> Letters, to this purpose. <hi>We are of that Nation, which fled from before the Face of</hi> Joshua <hi>the Robber, the Son of</hi> Nun. This War with the <hi>Canaanites</hi> lasted six Years, and some Months, as it appears by the Age of <hi>Caleb</hi> in whose time the Land was divided.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The Division of the Land commenc'd in the beginning of the Seventh Year from the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the <hi>Israelites</hi> into <hi>Canaan,</hi> and in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining of the 2555th Year of the World. It lasted a whole Year. So that from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World to the Finishing of this Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, we reckon 2555 Years, and 365 Weeks, or Septenary Periods of Years, equalling the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of natural Days in a Solar Year: So that from the begining of the World, we reckon on intire <hi>Hebdomas</hi> or Septenary Period of great Years, each of which contains as many Years, as there are Days in one Year; <hi>viz.</hi> 365. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the War had lasted six Years, the People rested in the Year of the Division as a Sabbatical Year: So that the commencement of the Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical

This incens'd God so much, that he deliver'd them into the Hands of Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants and Oppressors, who loaded them with heavy Afflictions. In the Interim he now and then raised up Judges to rescue them from the Calamities that had almost sink'd them; but the People rejected their Counsels.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Wherefore the Lord decreed, that those Nations which <hi>Joshua</hi> spar'd should continue in the Country, in order to try his People, and teach the <hi>Israelites</hi> the Art of War. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there were Five Lords of the <hi>Philistines</hi> left, together with those <hi>Canaanites, Sidonians</hi> and <hi>Hivites</hi> that inhabited Mount <hi>Lebanon</hi> from Mount <hi>Baal-hermon</hi> into the entring in of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth.</hi> The <hi>Israelites</hi> dwelt among the <hi>Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizites, Hivites,</hi> and <hi>Jebusites;</hi> they took their Daughters to be their Wives, and gave their own Daughters to their Sons, and serv'd their Gods.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. After the Land was divided by Lot, God gave them Judges for about 450 Years, till the Days of <hi>Samuel</hi> the Prophet, according to <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle. But that Passage in the First Book of the <hi>Kings,</hi> which says, that the Temple was founded by <hi>Solomon,</hi> only 480 Years after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:136207:27"/> seems to go against S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Computation. For this Number surpasses the other only by 30; whereas it should have 100 more, namely, the Six Years preceding the Division, those of the Government of <hi>Samuel,</hi> the Reigns of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and the Three Years of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Reign preceeding the Founding of the Temple. Some endeavour to reconcile these contradictory Passages; but others are forc'd to confess a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake in one of the two places.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. Some cry up the untainted Credit of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and say it is entitled to a Preference upon the score of its Antiquity. Others stand to St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Testimony, and alledge, That the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text is more liable to Errors and Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sights. If we reckon up the times of the Judges, and the Periods of their Persecutions, all apart, without confounding 'em together, then indeed this last Computation is entitled to a Preference. But this is the only Difficulty, the removal whereof would set the whole Series of Years in a clear Light, namely, That by this means the common <hi>Aera</hi> of the World will be enlarg'd by the Accession of 100 Years.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. The Scriptures do not expresly acquaint us how long <hi>Samuel</hi> govern'd the Republick; but it seems he govern'd 20 Years, that is, from the Death of <hi>Eli</hi> the Priest till the Election of <hi>Saul.</hi> For when his Sons were charg'd with Bribery, and the Mal-administration of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Affairs; and at the same time the <hi>Philistines</hi> and <hi>Ammonites</hi> made War with the <hi>Israelites;</hi> they were dissatisfy'd with their present Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and obtain'd from God a King, namely, <hi>Saul</hi> the Son of <hi>Kish</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin.</hi>

                     <p n="17">17. <hi>Saul</hi> being dead, <hi>David</hi> reign'd over the Tribe of <hi>Judah;</hi> and Seven years after, the other Tribes came in, <hi>Ishbosheth</hi> the Son of <hi>Saul</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving perish'd by the Treachery of his own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. He took <hi>Jerusalem</hi> from the <hi>Jebusites,</hi> and made it his Royal Seat. He routed the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listines</hi> in several Battels, and carried on every thing prosperously, till God punish'd him for his Ingratitude, in his Adultery with <hi>Bathsheba,</hi> and making away <hi>Uriah</hi> her Husband, in order to conceal the Wickedness. At last he took in <hi>Solomon</hi> his Son as Partner in the Government, and died Six Months after, having reigned 40 years. He was a gallant Warrier, an excellent Prophet, and a sweet Musician.

                     <p n="18">18. <hi>Solomon</hi> confirm'd his Government, by putting several Persons to Death. In the fourth Year of his Reign, the Second Day of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Month <hi>Ziphi,</hi> he laid the Foundation of the Temple of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which was built and finisht Seven Years after.

This provok'd God so, that he denounc'd the rending of his Kingdom.

                     <p n="3">3.

The Kingdom being thus divided, the Northern Countries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted, but those to the Southward continu'd in Subjection to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s posterity.

                     <p n="6">6. His Son <hi>Asa</hi> succeeded him in the later end of the 20th Year of <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Reign.

But in this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair he trusted too much in Human Means, and neglected God; whereupon he was check'd, and continual War denounc'd against him. Being fretted by the Divine Message, he was incens'd against the Prophet, and oppress'd some of his Subjects. In his Old Age he was seiz'd with the Gout, of which he died in the 41 Year of his Reign, having sought help from the Physicians, and not from God.</p>

Six Years after <hi>Jehojada</hi> brought <hi>Joash,</hi> then Seven Years old, to light, and having kill'd <hi>Athaliah</hi> with the Priests of <hi>Baal,</hi> anointed him as King.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. While <hi>Jehojada</hi> liv'd, <hi>Joash</hi> kept up to the Measures of Piety and Justice, and repair'd the Temple of God, which had then stood 155 Years, having gather'd a Collection for that purpose. <hi>Jehojada</hi> died, aged 130 Years; for the <hi>Jews</hi> observe, that this Restorer of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was born the same Year, that the Builder of the same died. When <hi>Jehojada</hi> was dead, <hi>Joash</hi> fell in with Idolatry and Cruelty; and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his Ingratitude to that pitch, that when <hi>Zacharias</hi> the Son and Successour of <hi>Jehojadah</hi> check'd him for worshipping Idols, he gave Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to stone him to death in the Porch of the Temple. In the end of this Year he was hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily punish'd by an invasion of the <hi>Syrians,</hi> and after their departure was seiz'd with grievous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers, and kill'd by his own Servants in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge of the Blood of <hi>Zacharias,</hi> in the 40th Year of his Reign, A.

                     <p n="11">11. Next succeeded <hi>Amasiah</hi> his Son, who seems to have reign'd jointly with his Father for three Years, since the Commencement of his Reign is dated in the 2d Year of <hi>Joash</hi> King of <hi>Israel.</hi> He put to death the Murtherers of

At first, things went well with him; but afterwards he fell in with Idolatry, slighted the Divine Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and hurried himself headlong into Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and at last to Destruction. He disoblig'd <hi>Joash,</hi> was taken Pris'ner by him, and largely fin'd.

In his time <hi>Judah</hi> flourish'd migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily. And about the 25 Year of his Reign, the first <hi>Olympiad</hi> was celebrated in the <hi>Morea,</hi> which sets the series of time in a Clearer light. When he invaded the Priests Office, by offering to sacrifice, he was smitten with a Leprosy, and thereupon separated from the Society of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, <hi>Jotham</hi> his Son being intrusted with the Administration of Affairs.

When he had reign'd 16 Years, <hi>Ahaz</hi> his Son succeeded him, having acted a part in the Government 7 or 8 Years before. <hi>Ahaz</hi> was mightily giv'n to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Idols, and committed many hainous Crimes.

                     <p n="14">14. <hi>Tiglathpilezer,</hi> having thus conquer'd the <hi>Syrians,</hi> turns the dint of his Arms upon <hi>Pekah,</hi> and carries off the <hi>Gileadites</hi> and <hi>Neph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalites</hi> into <hi>Assyria,</hi> as formerly he did the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Damascus.

Finding this Project successless, he lay down before <hi>Libnah,</hi> a fortified City of <hi>Judah;</hi> but upon advice that <hi>Shishak</hi> King of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> was marching towards him, he broke up the Siege: But having still an Eye upon the Riches of <hi>Judah,</hi> wrote a Letter to <hi>Hezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> stuff'd with Blasphemies and Threats, which did not pass with Impunity, for in one Night the Angel of the Lord cut off 180000 of his

                     <p n="16">16. In those Days <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was taken very ill, and by Prayer obtain'd the addition of 15 Years to his Life. Ambassadours being then sent from <hi>Babylon</hi> to congratulate his Recovery, he shew'd them all his Treasure; and God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offended by that Ostentation and Levity of Mind, denounc'd, that all should be carried off to <hi>Babylon.</hi> He reign'd 29 Years, three of which he was join'd to his Father. He abounded in Riches, was celebrated by Fame, and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a Stately Funeral by the People lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their loss.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. <hi>Manasseh</hi> his Son and Successour, whom he begot after the Recovery from his Illness, was 12 Years of Age when the Government came into his Hands. For Idolatry, and all other Wickedness, he went beyond ev'n all the Kings of the Gentiles. But being taken by the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> and bound in Chains, he repented; and God mov'd by his Supplications, restor'd him to his former Dignity. Being return'd home, he purg'd the Kingdom from Idols, 33 Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Death, according to the <hi>Jews.</hi> He reign'd 55 Years.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. <hi>Amon</hi> his Son succeeded to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Idolatry, but not to his Repentance. After two Years he was kill'd in his own House by a Domestick Conspiracy. The People pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd the Murderers, and set up <hi>Josiah</hi> his Son, then 8 Years of Age, to be their King, in the Fourth Year of the 35th <hi>Olympiad,</hi> A. M. 3368. <hi>Josiah</hi> stands highest in the Roll of the best Princes: he repair'd the Ruines of the Temple,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:136207:32"/> and restor'd the ancient and pure Worship of God. Towards the end of the 33 Year of his Reign, he unadvisedly engag'd in a War with <hi>Neco,</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and wou'd not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded from appearing in the Field in Person, where he was kill'd, to the infinite Loss and Grief of the People.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. While <hi>Neco</hi> was diverted by other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, the People anointed <hi>Jehoahaz</hi> or <hi>Shallum</hi> his Son, as King. But he follow'd the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his Ancestors, in doing what was evil in the Sight of the Lord, and enjoy'd his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom only three Months. For <hi>Neco,</hi> having compass'd his Design upon <hi>Babylon,</hi> carried <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoahaz</hi> to <hi>Egypt,</hi> and set his elder Brother <hi>Elia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kim</hi> upon the Throne, changing his Name to <hi>Jehojakim,</hi> and laying heavy Taxes upon the Kingdom.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. <hi>Neco</hi> was kill'd in the second expedition against the King of <hi>Babylon:</hi> After which <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezar</hi> came to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and made <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hojakim</hi> Tributary to him in the Fourth Year of his Reign.

Trusting to the Alliance of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> he broke his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of Allegiance. The King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> in revenge of the Breach of promise, comes up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and took all the Cities of <hi>Judah,</hi> excepting <hi>Jerusalem, Lachish,</hi> and <hi>Azekah,</hi> which he likewise besieg'd. The next Year <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> march'd out of <hi>Egypt</hi> in order to relieve <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dekiah;</hi> but upon advice that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> mov'd towards him, he retir'd.

                     <p n="22">22. <hi>Zedekiah</hi> fled, together with his Army; but was taken in the Plains of <hi>Jericho,</hi> and brought back to <hi>Riblah,</hi> where his Children were put to Death before his face, his own eyes put out, himself Bound in Chains and carried to <hi>Babylon,</hi> where he ended his days in Exile. The 10th day of the 5th Month (<hi>August</hi> 27.) on the very Sabbath-Day, the Execution being perhaps put off till that day, <hi>Nebuzaradan,</hi> Captain of the Guard, burnt the Temple of God, and the Palace, with all the Houses of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> In the same Month he broke down the Walls of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and Transported to <hi>Babylon</hi> all the People that were left in the City, and those who joyn'd in with the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> together with the Treasure of the King and Princes, and the Instruments of God's House.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. This Catastrophe of Affairs, the just con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:136207:33"/> of Impiety and Idolatry, happen'd 12 years after <hi>Jehojakim</hi>'s Death, 390 years after the Death of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and separation of the Tribes; (To which Number if we add two years more, at the end of which the total Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity was accomplish'd, <hi>Gedeliah</hi> being then dead, we'll find that it contains just 8 Jubilees:) 490 years after the beginning of <hi>Saul</hi>'s Reign: (From whence 'tis apparent that the Kingdom of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> lasted Ten Jubilees, or Seven <hi>Hebdomades</hi> or Septenary Periods of years, a Number equal to those attributed by <hi>Daniel</hi> to the Republick of <hi>Judah</hi> from its Restoration to the coming of the Messias;) and 420 after the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Temple, which at that rate stood just 8 Jubilees with 4 Weeks, or in all 60 Weeks of years.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. Now if we reckon 967 Years from their Entry into <hi>Canaan,</hi> by adding the 100 Years mention'd under the Head of their Judges. That Number will contain 138 Weeks of Years: And according to this computation there pass'd 1007 Years from their departure out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> in which time Satan was bound, and the People of God at liberty: And 3515 from the Creation of the World, which makes 502 Weeks of Years, or 71 Jubilees with 5 Weeks of Years.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. <hi>Gedaliah</hi> was set over the sorry Remains of the People of <hi>Judah.</hi> He freely offer'd all his Substance to his Subjects: But before he had compleated one Year, was kill'd at a Feast, to which he had been invited by one <hi>Ishmael</hi> sprung from the Royal Blood. The <hi>Jews</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus destitute of a Governor, many of 'em
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:136207:34"/> remov'd to <hi>Egypt,</hi> notwithstanding the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strances of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the Prophet, whom they consulted upon the matter, and oblig'd to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with 'em; and whom, if we credit the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, they afterwards ston'd to Death, for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding them with Idolatry, and threatning certain destruction both to them and the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians.</hi>

                     <p n="1">1. THE Ten Tribes that Revolted from <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam,</hi> elected <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the Son of <hi>Nebat,</hi> an <hi>Ephramite</hi> to be their King. He was very industrious in managing Fortifications, and was preferr'd by <hi>Solomon</hi> to be Ruler over all <hi>Joseph</hi>'s House. God being offended by <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>'s Idolatry, promis'd him the Government of the Ten Tribes; whereupon <hi>Solomon</hi> sought to kill him, but he fled into <hi>Egypt,</hi> where he
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:136207:34"/> lurk'd till the Death of <hi>Solomon.</hi> After his Death he was sent for; and first Headed the People as Speaker, and afterwards as their King.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> in order to prevent the Revolt of his new Subjects, diverted them from going to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> by erecting Two Golden Calves at <hi>Bethel</hi> and <hi>Dan,</hi> to be worshipp'd by the stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid people. He persisted obstinately in pursuing this invention, notwithstanding the promises and threats of God to bring him from it. He died the 22d Year of his Reign. His Son and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor <hi>Nadab</hi> Besieging <hi>Gibbethon</hi> of the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines, was kill'd by <hi>Basha,</hi> of the house of <hi>Isathar,</hi> in the second Year of his Reign: And all <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Race fell with him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Nadab</hi> is said to begin his Reign in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Year of <hi>Asa;</hi> and at the same time the Date of <hi>Basha</hi>'s Reign commonly commences in the Third Year of <hi>Asa.</hi> Now in order to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile these two passages, we must know that <hi>Jeroboam</hi> did not Reign full 22 years, but only a part of the 22d Year; so that the far greatest part of <hi>Nadab</hi>'s First Year is parallel with the greater part of the Second Year of <hi>Asa;</hi> and that <hi>Nadab</hi> did not Reign full Two Years, but only one Year, with part of another. By this means we see, the First Year of <hi>Basha</hi> will run parallel to the far greatest part of the Third Year of <hi>Asa.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. For, in the History of the Kings of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> these Remarks are commonly to be met with: Namely, 1. A Year begun is reckon'd as if 'twere intire and compleat. 2. The
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:136207:35"/> Fathers in their lifetime oftentimes took their Sons in to be partners with them in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 3. Some were twice install'd, as <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> and <hi>Hoshea.</hi> 4. There were many <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regnum</hi>'s, especially in the Kingdom of <hi>Israel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Baasha</hi> did not Reign full 24 Years, but only 23, and a small part of the 24th. <hi>Elah</hi> being dead, his Son succeeded in the 26th Year of <hi>Asa;</hi> and after he had Reign'd two Years, he and his whole Family was cut off by <hi>Zimri</hi>'s Treachery. Seven days after, <hi>Zimri</hi> was defeated by <hi>Omri,</hi> whom the Army that then lay before <hi>Gibbethon</hi> had declar'd King: But a division a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising among the People, part of them set up <hi>Tibni</hi> Son to <hi>Ginath:</hi> And that division lasted Three Years, that is, till <hi>Tibni</hi> died.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Omri</hi> began to Reign in the 31st year of <hi>Asa,</hi> that is, he began then to Reign without a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val; for 'twas in the latter end of the 27th or beginning of the 28 year of that Prince, that he kill'd <hi>Zimri.</hi> After he had reign'd six years at <hi>Tirzah,</hi> he translated the Seat of his Empire from thence to <hi>Samaria,</hi> which he built upon a Hill that he bought of one <hi>Semerus.</hi> He reign'd 12 Years. If we reckon these 12 Years as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing from the Death of <hi>Zimri,</hi> so as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the whole duration of his Government; then <hi>Ahab</hi> his Son and Successor Reign'd along with him only 2 Years; the Eleventh Year of his Reign falling parallel with the 38 of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa</hi>'s. But if they commence only from the Death of <hi>Tibni,</hi> then <hi>Ahab</hi> must have reign'd five Years jointly with his Father.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Ahab</hi>'s impiety out-strip'd that of any of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:136207:35"/> his Ancestors. He married <hi>Jezabel</hi> Daughter to <hi>Ethbaal</hi> King of the <hi>Sydonians,</hi> and worship'd <hi>Baal</hi> his Idol. When the <hi>Syrians</hi> besieg'd <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria,</hi> he routed them, and in a second engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment took <hi>Benhadad</hi> their King; but set him at liberty again, after entring into a League with him: for which the Lord denounc'd Death to him. Afterwards false Witnesses being su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born'd against <hi>Naboth</hi> for the sake of his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, he got him ston'd to Death. Three Years after the Conclusion of the Treaty with <hi>Benha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad,</hi> the War broke out again, and he died of a Wound receiv'd in Battel, in the 22 Year of his Reign.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. His Son <hi>Ahaziah</hi> succeeded, having acted a Part in the Government in his Father's Life. The Commencement of his Reign is dated in the 17th Year of <hi>Jehoshaphat,</hi> so that he reign'd one Year and part of another. In his Days the <hi>Moabites,</hi> who from <hi>David</hi>'s time were Subject to <hi>Israel,</hi> revolted from it. Next to him fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd <hi>Joram</hi> his Brother who persecuted the <hi>Moabites,</hi> and himself was maul'd by the <hi>Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> As he wag'd War with <hi>Hazael Benha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad</hi>'s Successor, he receiv'd a Wound in the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, and return'd to <hi>Jezreel</hi> to be cur'd. While he was gone, one of the Sons of the Prophets was sent by <hi>Elisha</hi> to anoint <hi>Jehu</hi> as King, who was then General to the Army. <hi>Jehu</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd to <hi>Jezreel,</hi> and kill'd <hi>Joram,</hi> after he had reign'd 12 Years.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Jehu</hi> cut off all the Race of <hi>Ahab;</hi> but retain'd the Worship of Idols. Tho' God gave him a Promise, as a Reward for his Service, in punishing the Family of <hi>Ahab,</hi> that he and his
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:136207:36"/> Posterity should enjoy the Kingdom to the 4th Generation: Yet, in his time, the Kingdom was lessen'd; for <hi>Hazael</hi> did not only subdue the <hi>Gileadites,</hi> but likewise all the People beyond <hi>Jordan,</hi> and treated them all cruelly, according to <hi>Elisha</hi>'s Prediction. The date of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of <hi>Jehu</hi>'s Reign is the same with that of <hi>Athaliah</hi>'s usurpation over <hi>Judah.</hi> He reign'd 28 Years.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>Jehoahaz</hi> succeeded to <hi>Jehu</hi> in the 23th Year of <hi>Joash.</hi> He worship'd <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Golden Calves, and enlarg'd his Idolatry by the accession of the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Grove. All his time <hi>Hazael</hi> the King of <hi>Syria</hi> oppress'd the <hi>Israelites;</hi> and tho' God sent them a Deliverer, yet neither the Prince, nor the People, repented. 17 Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he died; and his Son <hi>Joash</hi> succeeded, his Reign being dated from the 37th Year of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ash</hi> King of <hi>Judah;</hi> so that it seems he reign'd three Years along with his Father. He beat the <hi>Syrians</hi> thrice, and recover'd the Towns which his Father had lost. He joyn'd in with King <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> and took <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> and made a Breach 400 Cubits wide in the Wall, and return'd to <hi>Samaria</hi> with all the Treasure of the Temple and Palace. This Idolater reign'd 16 Years.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Next to him was <hi>Jeroboam</hi> his Son, by whom God not only sav'd <hi>Israel,</hi> but rais'd 'em to the highest pitch of Grandure, in recovering <hi>Damascus</hi> and <hi>Hamath,</hi> which by right belong'd to the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and repossess'd the Coast of <hi>Israel</hi> from the entring of <hi>Hamath</hi> to the Sea of the Plain, according to the Prediction of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> the Son of <hi>Amittai,</hi> who being born in <hi>Gatho-Chepher,</hi> a Town of the Tribe of <hi>Zebulun,</hi> in <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee</hi>
                        <pb n="49" facs="tcp:136207:36"/> of the Gentiles, was a Prophet rais'd up in <hi>Galilee;</hi> notwithstanding that the learned Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees, the inveterate Enemies of Christ, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded the contrary upon Him.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Tho' God loaded <hi>Jeroboam</hi> with so great and so many Favours, yet his Ingratitude was such, that he still countenanc'd that inveterate Idolatry of the Calves, introduc'd by <hi>Jeroboam</hi> his Predecessour. For all the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Kings look'd upon that as a secret and hidden Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their Government: Which certainly was the highest degree of Folly, since the divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence display'd it self to them in so many cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Proofs.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. He reign'd 41 Years. After his Death the Affairs of that Family, and at length those of the Kingdom it self, began to stagger. There happen'd at this time an <hi>Interregnum</hi> of 24 Years, for <hi>Zacharias</hi> his Son did not begin to govern till the 38 Year of <hi>Uzziah.</hi> Now the last Year ef <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Reign falls in with the 14th of <hi>Uzziah;</hi> and <hi>Uzziah</hi>'s Reign began in the 27th Year of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> who reign'd 41 Years.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. <hi>Zacharias</hi> following the Example of his Ancestours, continu'd his Reign only 6 Months, being kill'd by <hi>Shallum,</hi> who usurp'd the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the 29th Year of <hi>Uzziah. Shallum</hi> was brought to condign Punishment for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicide, about two Months after, by <hi>Menahem:</hi> Who likewise worship'd <hi>Jereboam</hi>'s Calves, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Impious Custom of the Kings of <hi>Israel;</hi> and by that means provok'd the Lord to stir up <hi>Pul</hi> King of <hi>Assyria</hi> to invade the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, after he had strugl'd and grapl'd with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Troubles for almost 22 Months, to secure to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:136207:37"/> himself the Possession of the Kingdom. But <hi>Pul</hi> was brib'd by 1000 Talents of Silver to confirm his Right. So that <hi>Menahem</hi> reign'd 10 Years, and then died.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. <hi>Pekahiah</hi> his Son succeeded, in the 50th Year of <hi>Azariah,</hi> or <hi>Uzziah.</hi> Whence we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that after <hi>Menahem</hi>'s Death there was an <hi>Iterregnum</hi> of at least One Year. Unless we join with some who think that <hi>Menahem</hi> did not reign Peaceably till about a Year after <hi>Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi>'s Death. So that, by that Calculation, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kahiah</hi> must begin his Reign in the beginning of the 50th Year of <hi>Uzziah;</hi> and a few Months being added to <hi>Menahem</hi>'s 10 Years, there will be no necessity of an <hi>Interregnum.</hi> However <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kahiah</hi> was a Prince of the same Kidney with his Ancestours; and having reign'd two Years, was kill'd by <hi>Pekah</hi> the Son of <hi>Remaliah.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="16">16. <hi>Pekah</hi> join'd in with the <hi>Syrians</hi> in afflicting <hi>Ahaz</hi> King of <hi>Judah.</hi> He kill'd 120000 of the stoutest <hi>Jews</hi> in one Day.

                     <p n="18">18. <hi>Hoshea</hi> the 19th and last King of <hi>Israel</hi> began to reign in the 12 Year of <hi>Ahaz</hi> as Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with his Father for 7 or 8 Years; for he did not administer Affairs by himself till the 17 Year of <hi>Pekah,</hi> so that <hi>Hoshea</hi>'s Reign is right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully dated from the 20 Year after the inaugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Jotham.</hi> This is the only account can be given, unless we can produce some proof of an <hi>Interregnum</hi> for 8 or 9 Years, in which the disorder of Affairs kept <hi>Hoshea</hi> out of a peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Possession. But according to that Calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we must add as many Years to the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Reign.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. <hi>Hoshea</hi> was as Idolatrous, but not so obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate as his Ancestours. By the advice of <hi>So</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> he refus'd to pay the yearly Tribute to <hi>Salmanassar.</hi> The King of <hi>Assyria</hi> smell'd out the Conspiracy; and took Possession of the Land of the <hi>Moabites,</hi> designing to make all sure behind him; and then he invaded the whole Countrey of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and laid siege to <hi>Samaria,</hi> in the 4 Year of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and the 9 of <hi>Hoshea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="20">20. Towards the end of the third Year, he carried the Town, and carried off the <hi>Israelites</hi> to <hi>Chalah, Chabor, Neharogosan,</hi> and the Cities of <hi>Media;</hi> because they had rebell'd against their Lord and their God. In the Countries for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly possess'd by them he planted new Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, that formerly liv'd upon the River <hi>Chuth,</hi> and were afterwards call'd <hi>Samaritans.</hi> This was
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:136207:38"/> the fatal exit of the Kingdom of <hi>Israel,</hi> which happen'd 255 Years after the Division of the Tribes, 134 Years before the Destruction of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> and the Transportation of the People of <hi>Judah,</hi> A. M. 3280.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. IN the Division of the Earth, <hi>Egypt</hi> and all <hi>Africa</hi> were allotted to <hi>Cham</hi>'s Posterity; and 'tis thought he himself liv'd in <hi>Egypt.</hi> Upon which account <hi>David</hi> do's often call it the Land of <hi>Cham; Plutarch</hi> would have it <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia;</hi> and <hi>Stephanus, Hermochymia.</hi> The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants themselves christen'd it <hi>Cham;</hi> and the particular Divisions were call'd <hi>Chemmim, Psochemmim,</hi> and <hi>Psittachemmim.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The neighbouring Places of <hi>Africa</hi> did likewise derive their Names from the Posterity of <hi>Cham:</hi> Upon the River <hi>Magra,</hi> we find the City of <hi>Ammon;</hi> in the Island <hi>Meroe,</hi> the Temple of <hi>Ammon;</hi> in <hi>Barcha,</hi> the Town of <hi>Ammon</hi> commonly call'd <hi>Panaetonium;</hi> and in the Country of <hi>Ammon,</hi> the famous Oracle of <hi>Jupiter Hammon</hi> or <hi>Ammon. Arabia</hi> likewise the neighbouring Country bears proof of the same Posterity; for the Word <hi>Ammon</hi> (without the Aspiration usual elsewhere) is frequently us'd among them, as it plainly appears from the River <hi>Ammon,</hi> the Promontory <hi>Ammon,</hi> and the People of <hi>Ammon.</hi>

                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:136207:38"/>3. When <hi>Cham</hi> died, the Government fell into the Hands of his second Son <hi>Misraem,</hi> or rather him whom <hi>Moses</hi> calls the Prince of the Inhabitants of <hi>Misraim;</hi> for that Word is in the Dual Number, and therefore can scarcely be look'd upon as a Man's Name. This Country in Scripture is often call'd <hi>Masor</hi> which is the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Number of <hi>Misraim</hi> the contraction of <hi>Mesoraim;</hi> and signifies a fortify'd or narrow Place. Now such is <hi>Egypt</hi> above all other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To this very Day <hi>Cairo</hi> the Metropolitan is call'd by the <hi>Arabs Mesre,</hi> and in former times the <hi>Egyptians</hi> call'd the first Month <hi>Mesori.</hi> But the Dual Number <hi>Misraim</hi> seems to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that <hi>Egypt</hi> was divided into the upper and the lower: The former water'd by the River <hi>Nile,</hi> as it runs in one great Channel, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into <hi>Thebais</hi> and <hi>Heptanomus;</hi> the latter call'd by the Grecians <hi>Delta,</hi> from its Triangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Figure, where the River is divided into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Channels.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Misraim</hi> is thought to be the same with <hi>Osiris,</hi> the Son of <hi>Saturn,</hi> and of <hi>Jupiter Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> For the Grecians call <hi>Osiris, Dionysus;</hi> and <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> says he was so call'd from his Father and his Country; the former signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and the latter <hi>Nyse,</hi> a Town of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabia Faelix,</hi> built by <hi>Cham,</hi> where it seems <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raim</hi> was born. From the Reign of <hi>Osiris</hi> to the descent of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Priests reckon up 10000 Years, and some 23000.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But, since 'tis agreed upon by all, that the various Motion of the Planets along the Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:136207:39"/> occasion'd a great variety in the Forms of the Years us'd in Ancient times, 'tis therefore to be conjectur'd, that these were only Lunar Years, that is, each of 'em consisting of one Month. Accordingly, <hi>James Capellus</hi> reckons 1889 Years from that <hi>Osiris</hi> to the descent of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, beginning the Computation from A. M. 1778, or 132 Years after the Deluge at the same time that <hi>Nimrod</hi> his Nephew gave being to the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Empire.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. There are a great many Stories told of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siris,</hi> and <hi>Isis</hi> his Sister whom he married; which the Grecians fabulously applyed to <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> and <hi>Ceres.</hi> He built the <hi>Egyptian Thebes,</hi> with 100 Gates, which was the chief Seat of the first Kings. At length he was kill'd by his impious Brother <hi>Typhon,</hi> who usurp'd the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but was quickly outted and put to Death by <hi>Isis</hi> and <hi>Orus. Isis</hi> gather'd the Members of her Husband, which <hi>Typhon</hi> had tore asunder, and instituted Divine Honors to his Memory; enacting, that each Tribe of Priests should wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship some certain consecrated Animal in his Room. There were various kinds of Animals consecrated, according to the diversity of Places; But 'tis universally agreed on, that the Cow <hi>Apis</hi> was most esteem'd and worship'd, by Reason of that Creature's Usefulness for the Food of Man.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Now <hi>Apis</hi> was black all over the Body, with a square white Spot, according to <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus</hi> in the Forehead, and according to <hi>Pliny</hi> in the right Side; resembling the Horns of the Moon when it begins to wax; for <hi>Marcellinus</hi> says, it was dedicated to the Moon: It had
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:136207:39"/> likewise the stamp of an Eagle upon its Back, upon its Tongue a Knot like a Beetle, and double Rolls of Hair upon its Tail. When it died, they were mightily afflicted, and were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in quest of another: Neither did their Lamentation cease, till they found a Cow di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish'd by such Marks, in order to make it an <hi>Apis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> ador'd <hi>Apis</hi> as the greatest God, and, as <hi>Macrobius</hi> says, worship'd it with a Veneration full of astonishment and fear. There was a certain Period of years determin'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond which it was not to go: When it arriv'd at the Critical year, the Priests drown'd it in a Ditch. Some alledged this Cow was ador'd, out of Honor to <hi>Apys</hi> King of the <hi>Argivans</hi> who went down to <hi>Egypt:</hi> For that King was rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd a God, and call'd <hi>Serapis:</hi> But there were several Kings of that name in several Places, and Authors commonly confound them.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. The Course of time, and the Tricks of the Priests, who invented whatever tended to the Honor, and conceal'd whatever redounded to the Dishonor of their Country; have brought things to that pass, that we can scarce fix upon any thing as certain in those Ancient Times. They talk of a great many Reigns before <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram</hi>'s Days: Whose Birth calculated to the 43d year of <hi>Ninus</hi> they make contemporary to their Sixteenth Reign. A great deal of Pains and Labor is spent in reconciling and ordering these Governments. If we approve of 'em, we must allot only 200 years to the first Fifteen, the time being so short.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Some fancy that these were not Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:136207:40"/> of Kings, but only so many <hi>Series</hi>'s of Viceroy's of different Sizes and Ranks, who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd the Republick, when the Kings were la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy. <hi>Eusebius</hi> has turn'd and moulded these Reigns so variously, in order to make 'em Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable in the regulating of time; that <hi>James Capellus</hi> thought it improper to insert the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of the Kings in his Chronicle; for <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netho,</hi> whom <hi>Scaliger</hi> produces to correct all the Errors of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> is least of all to be credited. However since young Students ought to know something of the uncertain times, I rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon 'twill not be amiss briefly to run over such of those uncertain occurrences as best Merit our Belief.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. After <hi>Typhon</hi>'s Death, 'tis said that <hi>Isis</hi> Reign'd joyntly with <hi>Orus,</hi> or <hi>Horus,</hi> her Son, who was reckon'd the last of their gods. He instituted a Year consisting of Three Months, which from him was call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Next to the gods Reign'd <hi>Menas,</hi> or <hi>Menis:</hi> Some will have this word only to signify some Dignity, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his Name was <hi>Osiris,</hi> or, according to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>Trismegistus,</hi> or, as some would have it, <hi>Sesostris.</hi> Others again give it in for a Man's Name. 'Tis uncertain who succeeded to him, for the Priests forg'd a List of 52 Kings suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in order, in the space of 1400 years.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. In this uncertain period of Time, we must have recourse to the order of the Reigns, tho' it be a blind one; and passing over 17, for which 400 years are allotted, the 18th must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, according to our computation, Nine years before <hi>Eusebius</hi>'s method, that is in the 107th year of the Patriarch <hi>Jacob.</hi> Now the first of this List was <hi>Amos,</hi> or <hi>Amosis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:136207:40"/>14. <hi>Amosis,</hi> they say, Reign'd 25 years. At this rate, this must be he who preferr'd <hi>Joseph</hi> to the highest Dignities in <hi>Egypt. Eusebius</hi> reckons 11 Kings from him to <hi>Cenchres,</hi> who treated the <hi>Israelites</hi> with all manner of Indignities, and as he pursued them upon their Flight, was drown'd in the Red-Sea. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> have always own'd and boasted that the <hi>Jews</hi> went out from them; but to avoid the Dishonour, and conceal their own Disaster, have obtruded an Infinity of staring Lyes upon the vulgar People, by the Ministry of some foul-mouth'd Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, particularly <hi>Manetho, Chaeremon, Lysima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> and <hi>Apion</hi> the <hi>Grammarian;</hi> whose fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous Advances are sufficiently refuted by <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="15">15. A certain Learned Author prefers <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netho</hi>'s List to that of <hi>Eusebius,</hi> and would have the Name of <hi>Cenchres</hi> to be <hi>Ramesses Miamun,</hi> who oppress'd the <hi>Israelites</hi> with that severe Bondage. Indeed the long continuance of his Reign, <hi>viz.</hi> for Sixty Years and Two Months, seems to imply some such thing; and 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable the Town of <hi>Rameses,</hi> which the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> provided Materials for, was so Christen'd from his Name. His Son and Successor <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophis</hi> was brought to condign Punishment for his Cruelty, being swallow'd up by the Waves 19 years and 6 Months after. Next to <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophis, Manetho</hi> places <hi>Sethosis,</hi> who made <hi>Armais</hi> his Brother Viceroy, and subdued a great part of the World with his Naval and Land Forces: But upon Advice that his Brother usurp'd the Government, return'd home, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd his Subjects to their wonted Allegiance.</p>
                  <p n="16">
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:136207:41"/>16. <hi>Manetho</hi> adds, That this <hi>Sethosis</hi> was call'd <hi>Aegyptus,</hi> from whom the Country de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd its Name; and <hi>Armais</hi> was Sirnam'd <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naus.</hi> If these advances be allow'd, then <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nophis</hi> who was drown'd in the Red-Sea, must be that <hi>Belus,</hi> whom the <hi>Grecians</hi> give in for the Father of <hi>Aegyptus</hi> and <hi>Danaus.</hi> But that <hi>Belus</hi> must not be confounded with the Father of <hi>Ninus,</hi> (as the Mythologists do.) He liv'd according to the above-mention'd computation about 322 years before the taking of <hi>Troy,</hi> which agrees exactly to the time of <hi>Amenophis.</hi> Besides, the Name of <hi>Rameses Miamun</hi> qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drates with <hi>Neptune:</hi> Since <hi>Mia</hi> without any stretch may be deriv'd from <hi>Moy,</hi> which, in the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Language, if we may credit <hi>Josephus,</hi> signifies <hi>Waters.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="17">17. <hi>Neptune,</hi> they say, begot <hi>Busirides,</hi> who at this time liv'd near the River <hi>Nile,</hi> and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Inhabitants very barbarously. Now that Fable seems to be taken from <hi>Amenophis</hi>'s cruelty to the <hi>Israelites.</hi> Besides, <hi>Gellius</hi> tells us, That the Poets us'd to represent the <hi>Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes</hi> as cruel and barbarous, as deriving their Original from the frothy and troubled Sea: From whence we conclude, that the word <hi>Neptune</hi> sprung from the occasion now mention'd.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. To compare this account of Things, with the other given in by the <hi>Grecians: Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi> say they, married <hi>Libya</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Epaphus,</hi> and begot <hi>Belus</hi> and <hi>Agenor. Agenor</hi> went off to <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> and died there. <hi>Egypt</hi> was allotted to <hi>Belus,</hi> who begot <hi>Aegyptus</hi> and <hi>Danaus</hi> upon <hi>Anchinoe,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Nilus. Danaus</hi> was sent into <hi>Africa,</hi> or <hi>Libya</hi> so call'd
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:136207:41"/> from his Mother. <hi>Aegyptus</hi> conquer'd the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of the <hi>Melampodes</hi> or black Feet, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten'd it <hi>Egypt</hi> after himself, which formerly was call'd <hi>Aeria,</hi> and <hi>Potamitis.</hi> However, <hi>Manetho</hi>'s <hi>Sesothes</hi> mention'd by <hi>Josephus,</hi> seems to be the same with <hi>Diodorus</hi>'s <hi>Sesooses,</hi> and <hi>Heredotus</hi>'s <hi>Sesostres:</hi> Since the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of Power, Warlike Preparations, Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Success, and Magnificence ascrib'd to them, resemble those of the other.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. Next to <hi>Sesostres,</hi> his Son of the same Name succeeded. He was follow'd by several others, till the days of <hi>Amoses,</hi> who by his Tyranny open'd a Door to the <hi>Ethiopians;</hi> whose King <hi>Artisanes</hi> us'd his Power but moderately, in punishing the Criminals not with Death, but with cutting off their Noses, and banishing them to the Confines of <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> where he built a Town call'd <hi>Rhinocolura,</hi> from the maim'd condition of the Inhabitants. He pitch'd upon such a place as by its barrenness and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperateness of Air oblig'd them to work hard for their living, which they got by Fishing in the Sea that lay just by them.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> at length recover'd their own Government, and set up <hi>Mendes,</hi> one of their own Nation, to be their King. He spent all his time in building a Tomb; which, tho' inimitable, serv'd for a Pattern to <hi>Daedalus.</hi> A long Anarchy ensued; after which, one <hi>Cetes,</hi> a very ordinary Man, was made King. The <hi>Grecians</hi> call'd him <hi>Proteus.</hi> In the time of the Trojan War he was a noted Astrologer, and admirably well vers'd in the Knowledge of the Winds. This his distinguishing Talent, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:136207:42"/> with the Custom of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Kings in wearing the various Forms of Creatures, Trees, and Fire, painted upon the Ornaments of their Heads, gave occasion to the <hi>Grecian</hi> Fable, That he was a Man that could transform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into all Shapes.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. <hi>Remphis</hi> his Son made Mony his whole Business. The next remarkable Prince was <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leus,</hi> who took a great deal of Pains to turn the Water of the River <hi>Aegyptus</hi> upon the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Grounds, and by so doing christen'd the River <hi>Nilus</hi> from his own name. The eighth in order from <hi>Nileus</hi> was <hi>Chemmis,</hi> who rear'd up the largest of the three Pyramids, which is usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally reckon'd among the Seven Wonders of the World. <hi>Herodotus</hi> tells you that one <hi>Cheopes</hi> was the first that gave his mind to the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these Mad Piles; that he prostituted his own Daughter to fetch in Mony for carrying on the Work; and that the largest Pyramid was not finish'd till after 20 Years and that by 100000 Workmen, for whose maintainance 1600 Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents were laid out upon Parsley, Onyons, and Garlick.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. After a long course of Years, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom came once more into the Hands of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopians,</hi> whose King <hi>Sabacus,</hi> or <hi>Sabacon,</hi> put none to Death in <hi>Egypt,</hi> but sentenc'd the Criminals, in proportion to the Demerit of their Crime, to heap up a determin'd Measure of Bullwarks within the Cities where they dwelt. By which means the Cities were made more Stately. The first digging up of Earth for this use was perform'd by those who had digg'd for the Channels of Rivers under <hi>Sesostres. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacus</hi>
                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:136207:42"/> is thought to be the same with <hi>So</hi> the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian,</hi> that joyn'd in the Conspiracy, with <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shea</hi> King of <hi>Israel,</hi> against <hi>Salmanasar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="23">23. <hi>Sathon</hi> the Priest of <hi>Vulcan</hi> follow'd him. 'Tis said, he put no Confidence in his Army, but obtain'd help from God against the <hi>Assyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> But the Holy Scriptures do plainly give us to know, that the <hi>Assyrians</hi> invaded <hi>Egypt,</hi> and carried off in Captivity a large number of the Inhabitants. Some say this Prince was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd immediately by <hi>Tirac,</hi> or <hi>Tirhak,</hi> who oblig'd <hi>Sennacherib</hi> to retire, invaded <hi>Europe,</hi> and reach'd as far as the <hi>Straits</hi> of <hi>Gibraltar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="24">24. After him a two Years Anarchy ensued, and after that the Government was adminstred by 12 Men; but at last one of them, namely <hi>Psammeticus,</hi> converted it into a Monarchy. This Prince lay 29 Years before <hi>Azot,</hi> or <hi>Ashdod,</hi> in <hi>Syria;</hi> and 'tis said, he was the first <hi>Egyptian</hi> King, that entertain'd any correspondence with the <hi>Grecians. Herodotus</hi> says, that all the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences posterior to his Government are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and free of all Ambiguity. His Son and Successor was <hi>Necus,</hi> call'd in Scripture <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oh-Neco,</hi> who first attempted to run the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal along to the Red Sea, capable to receive two Gallies a Breast, and four Days sailing long.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. In digging this Ditch under <hi>Neco</hi> 12000 <hi>Egyptians</hi> perish'd; and the King desisted from the interprise, being discourag'd by an Oracle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting him that the Work he was upon would fall into the Hands of a <hi>Barbarian.</hi> Now the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> as well as the Greeks, look'd upon all Nations as Barbarous, that did not
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:136207:43"/> speak their Language. <hi>Neco</hi> giving over the Thoughts of perfecting the Ditch, bended his Mind upon his Army, and march'd against the King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> upon which occasion <hi>Josiah</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> appearing in the Field against him, receiv'd a mortal Wound. <hi>Neco</hi> plac'd <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hojakim</hi> his Son upon the Throne, whom <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezar</hi> afterwards sollicited to break his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to <hi>Neco;</hi> whereupon he march'd towards the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and was there kill'd.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. <hi>Herodotus</hi> tells you that <hi>Neco</hi> engag'd with the <hi>Syrians</hi> and carried the Victory, and made himself Master of <hi>Cadytum</hi> a great Town in <hi>Syria,</hi> the same with <hi>Kadesh</hi> mention'd by <hi>Moses.</hi> After his Death <hi>Psammis,</hi> or <hi>Psammi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichus</hi> his Son succeeded, and then <hi>Apries</hi> his Grandchild, who was so lifted up with a long course of Prosperity, that he aspir'd beyond the Bounds of Human Nature. As he besieg'd <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene,</hi> he met with a Defeat, which his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers charg'd him with, and revolted.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. Upon Advice of their Mutiny, he sent <hi>Amasis</hi> to pacify them; but he was presently declared King by the Army. Soon after <hi>Apries</hi> having no Body to back him, but mercenary Troops, was taken Prisoner by his Enemies and strangled: He thought before, that he had so establish'd his Kingdom, that neither Gods nor Men could wrest it out of his Hands.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. This was the <hi>Exit</hi> of <hi>Apries,</hi> if ye'll Credit the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who have been very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to conceal whatever tends to the Discredit of their Country. But <hi>Josephus</hi>'s Account is more agreeable to the Holy Scriptures, <hi>scil.</hi> that <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> in the 23 Year of his Reign, and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:136207:43"/> the 5th Year after the Destruction of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> subdued <hi>Egypt,</hi> put their King to Death, and plac'd another on his Throne. Some think <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masis</hi> was instrumental in bringing this about, and that he was made Viceroy: Others alledge that the <hi>Assyrian</hi> Viceroy that ministred to the Bondage of <hi>Egypt,</hi> was afterwards kill'd by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masis,</hi> and the others return'd from their Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. <hi>Amasis,</hi> a Man of a mean Birth, was at first but little respected, tho' afterwards he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd a great deal of Esteem; for the <hi>Egyptians</hi> Glory, that in his time the Land was most hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, both in the advantage that accrued from the River to the Country, and the Profit that the Inhabitants made of their Grounds; and that the Cities then inhabited were in number 1020. <hi>Amasis</hi> enacted a Law, appointing every Man to give an account of himself to the Governor, how he liv'd, and upon what; annexing the Penalty of Death upon all that either did not or could not give a good Account of their way of living. <hi>Solon</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> took this Law from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and publish'd it among the <hi>Athenians</hi> which they always observ'd.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. 'Tis very probable that <hi>Amasis</hi> was Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary to the King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> and rebell'd or else expell'd the Viceroy; and this was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son (whatever the Priests may have forg'd) that <hi>Cambyses</hi> the Persian invaded <hi>Egypt,</hi> and made it a Province of the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that was not accomplish'd in the Days of <hi>Amasis,</hi> for he died in the very beginning of Hostilities. But 'twas <hi>Psammenitus</hi> his Son that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:136207:44"/> was conquer'd, and at once lost both his Life and his Kingdom.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. As for Antiquity, the Kingdom of <hi>Egypt</hi> was inferior to none: tho' at the same time the Priests have carried it prodigiously wide of the true <hi>Epocha.</hi> In <hi>Abrahams</hi> Days, before the People of <hi>Israel</hi> had a being, 'twas a very flourishing Kingdom. The <hi>Ethiopians</hi> indeed boasted in a Preference upon the score of Antiquity, going up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Fable that <hi>Egypt</hi> was the Gift of the <hi>Nile:</hi> Whereas any who traces their Original thro' some thousands of Years will find that the slime cast up by the River <hi>Nile</hi> did not amount to any such considerable accession, but that Towns are still found in <hi>Egypt</hi> equally distant from the <hi>Nile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="32">32. The Antiquity, which the <hi>Grecians</hi> claim a Right to, is ridiculous and contemptible up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the comparison with that of the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> The Splendour of the Greek Republicks is but of Yesterday; their Laws, Politicks, Religion, and Rights, are late things; and, if we believe the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> are borrow'd from them. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it is apparent, that the knowledge of Letters, Civil Government, and the Invention of a great many things, arriv'd to a considerable Maturity among the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> before they were ever heard of in <hi>Greece, Italy,</hi> and the Western Parts of the World. But the <hi>Egyptians</hi> are Proud of boasting, that <hi>Greece</hi> borrow'd these things from them.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. Especially, they alledge; that the whole Religious Worship with the Names of the Gods, bating a few minute things, foisted in to disguise the Truth, are owing to them. <hi>Osiris,</hi>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:136207:44"/> say they, was the true <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and the fable of <hi>Semele</hi> was invented by <hi>Orpheus. Isis</hi> was the true <hi>Ceres,</hi> and the <hi>Egyptian Hercules</hi> was not born in the Age preceding the <hi>Trojan</hi> War, but in the first beginning of the World, with which the Club of <hi>Hercules</hi> and the Hides of Lyons were more suitable, as well as the slaughter of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and Wild Beasts, with which the Earth, in that its impolish'd Condition, did then abound: <hi>Apollo,</hi> continue they, was only <hi>Orus,</hi> who taught the Art of Prophesying, and curing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases by his Mother <hi>Isis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="34">34. Here a young Historian may take occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to observe the uncertainty and inconstancy of the Heathen Vanities. The same Person is by one taken for <hi>Isis,</hi> by another for <hi>Ceres,</hi> a third <hi>Thesmophoris,</hi> and a fourth <hi>Juno:</hi> and some fancy that all these different Names do proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relate to one and the same Person. Some take <hi>Osiris</hi> for <hi>Serapis,</hi> some for <hi>Dionysius,</hi> some for <hi>Pluto,</hi> some for <hi>Ammon</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and some again for <hi>Pan,</hi> as <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self observes.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. Tho' it is not altogether true that the World owes the use of Letters to them; yet it is certain that the more liberal Sciences began to be propagated among them in the earliest times of Antiquity. Besides the common way of writing, they likewise made use of Hieorogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicks, in which a Letter signifies a Word, and a Word expresses a whole Sentence. Tho the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians</hi> vie with them for the Knowledge of Astronomy, yet the evenness of their Ground and the clearness of their Air, might contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:136207:45"/> much to promote their Knowledge of the Stars.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. It seldom rains in <hi>Egypt,</hi> the defect of that Moisture being supply'd by the yearly Inundations of the <hi>Nile.</hi> If the World owes them any thing upon the score of Geometry, they were beholden for that to their beneficial River, the inundations whereof defac'd the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions and boundaries of their Lands, and so drove the Inhabitants upon a necessity of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out a way to Measure their Grounds. But in order to prove that the most ingenious Arts and the best Laws were translated from thence to <hi>Greece,</hi> they give the following account.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. The Priests boasted that they met with a List in the Sacred Archives, and several other E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, importing that <hi>Orpheus</hi> translated the Misteries of <hi>Ceres,</hi> and the Fable of the infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal World, from <hi>Egypt;</hi> and that the <hi>Acherusian Lake,</hi> over which they carried their dead in a Boat to be interr'd, gave occasion to the forging all the different apartments below, and putting up <hi>Charon</hi> as Ferry-man. <hi>Museus,</hi> continue they, <hi>Melampus, Daedalus</hi> and <hi>Homer</hi> travel'd into <hi>Egypt</hi> for the improvement of their Minds, as also the Legislators, <hi>Lycurgus</hi> the Spartan, <hi>Solon</hi> the Athenian, and <hi>Plato;</hi> the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers <hi>Pithagoras</hi> of <hi>Samos, Democritus</hi> of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dera, Oenopius</hi> of <hi>Chios,</hi> and <hi>Eudoxus</hi> the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematican; who, all of 'em, water'd barren and impolish'd <hi>Greece</hi> with the Wisdom they had suck'd in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="38">38. The Invention of Philosophy and Laws, together with the whole <hi>Egyptian</hi> Wisdom, are by some attributed to <hi>Hermes</hi> or <hi>Mercurius Tris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megistus:</hi>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:136207:45"/> But we know nothing certain of that Man, who he was, or when he liv'd. <hi>Cotta</hi> reckons up five <hi>Mercuries:</hi> The first sprung from <hi>Caelus</hi> for his Father and <hi>Dies</hi> for his Mother; The second the Son of <hi>Valens</hi> and <hi>Phonoris,</hi> who was call'd <hi>Triphonius,</hi> and rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd to reside under the Earth; The third the Son of <hi>Jupiter</hi> the third and <hi>Maja;</hi> the fourth the Son of <hi>Nilus,</hi> whom the <hi>Egyptians</hi> thought it a Crime to mention; the fifth was worship'd by the People of <hi>Pheneum,</hi> and, they say, kill'd <hi>Argus,</hi> upon which account he was set over <hi>Egypt,</hi> and taught the <hi>Egyptians</hi> Laws and Letters.</p>
                  <p n="39">39. He was call'd by the <hi>Egyptians Theut.</hi> But others do justly attribute the Invention of Letters to the first <hi>Mercurius,</hi> who was the true <hi>Theut, Thoyoth, Thot,</hi> or <hi>Tautus;</hi> for there can be nothing more absurd than to say, that Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were first carried out of <hi>Greece</hi> into <hi>Egypt.</hi> Some alledge there were two <hi>Egyptian Mercuries,</hi> the former being the Nephew of the latter; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers think <hi>Joseph</hi> was the only <hi>Mercurius;</hi> others again think there was no other besides <hi>Moses.</hi> Whoever he was, it is apparent from his Books, some of which are lost and some still extant, that he was not ignorant of the true Divinity, and merited to be enroll'd among the <hi>Sybille</hi> or Heathen Prophets.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> arrogate to themselves the Glory of planting many Colonies abroad. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> the Son of <hi>Libya</hi> and <hi>Neptune</hi> planted the first in the Country of <hi>Babylon; Danaus</hi> planted a second in <hi>Greece,</hi> fixing his Seat at <hi>Argos,</hi> which was almost the Ancientest City in <hi>Greece.</hi>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:136207:46"/> They plead the Circumcision, as an argument that the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Colchi</hi> came from them. They alledge that <hi>Cadmus</hi> and <hi>Phaenices</hi> inhabited the <hi>Egyptian Thebes,</hi> and carried the name of the City into <hi>Greece. Cecrops,</hi> they say, did lead the first <hi>Athenians</hi> out from <hi>Sai</hi> the mouth of the River <hi>Nile. Peleus</hi> the Father of <hi>Menestheus,</hi> and <hi>Erechtheus</hi> came likewise from <hi>Egypt;</hi> and it was <hi>Erechtheus</hi> his carrying a large quantity of Corn to <hi>Athens,</hi> that gave rise to that Fable, that <hi>Ceres</hi> at that time came into <hi>Greece.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="41">41. The Government of <hi>Egypt</hi> in the first times was Monarchical; and indeed in those days it was such every where else. But the Princes suffer'd themselves to be confin'd by such Laudable Statutes, that it was not in their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to transgress the bounds of Equity and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, but they were ty'd up to such an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration as purchas'd them Happiness at Home and Glory abroad. <hi>Sesoosis</hi> or <hi>Sesostris,</hi> divided the Country into 36 Divisions, each of which included a certain number of Cities with Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Lands. Ten of these belong'd to <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bais,</hi> ten to <hi>Delta,</hi> and the rest to the interja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Countries. Each of 'em had its own Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour who collected the Kings Taxes and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd them. The Hereditary Right to the Lands was divided among the Priests, King and Soldiers: The People was divided into Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, Husbandmen, and Tradesmen.</p>
                  <p n="42">42. The Court of Justice was managed by 30 Judges, noted for their Probity and Knowledge in the Law; ten whereof were elected out of the Province of <hi>Heliopolis,</hi> ten out of <hi>Memphis,</hi> and as many out of <hi>Thebais.</hi> If the President
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:136207:46"/> was chosen out of their Number, another of the same Province was put into his place. There were no Barristers employ'd among them, for fear of disguising and sinking the Truth in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Words. They had many Laudable Laws; none of which was more famous than that of <hi>Amasis,</hi> by which they were all oblig'd, upon the pain of Death, to give an account how they liv'd.</p>
                  <p n="43">43. They had a very peculiar and remarkable Statute, requiring all that gave themselves to Theft, to enter their Names with the Captain of the Thieves, and give in to him what they got according to their agreement. At the same time whoever lost any thing were oblig'd to write down a particular account of what they lost, together with the place, day, and hour in which the loss happen'd. By this means e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing was easily found again, and when the Goods were apprais'd, the true owner redeem'd them for a quarter of their value. Thus, since it was not possible to keep all the People from Theft, the Law-giver found a way of recovering what was lost for a small matter.</p>
                  <p n="44">44. The first <hi>Egyptian</hi> Law-giver was <hi>Mnevis,</hi> who said he had the Laws from <hi>Mercury;</hi> the second <hi>Sasyches;</hi> the third <hi>Sesostris</hi> that great Warriour; the fourth <hi>Bocchoris,</hi> whose Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risms were long preserv'd after him; the fifth <hi>Amasis,</hi> who by his extraordinary Wisdom did much promote the interest of <hi>Egypt:</hi> The last was <hi>Darius</hi> the Son of <hi>Hystaspes</hi> King of <hi>Persia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="45">45. As for their Customs, all the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> bateing the Priests, were allow'd to Marry as
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:136207:47"/> many Wives as they wou'd. Their Children by their Servant Maids were upon the same foot with those by their Wives. They were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducated very sparingly, at the rate of Twenty Drachms of Silver for their Board. Every Man bred up his Sons to succeed to his Trade as well as to his Estate. And all of 'em were taught some Science or other. They slighted Musick, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Instrument of softness. They Purg'd their Bodies once a Month; but had no Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians that pretended to the Universal Cure of all Diseases. They that were, were maintain'd upon the Publick, and ty'd up to certain Forms and Rules, which if they transgressed, and if their Patients died, they were punish'd for their temerity with the loss of their Lives.</p>
                  <p n="46">46. This was the Acient State of the Affairs of <hi>Egypt;</hi> according to the Account given by the <hi>Egyptians</hi> themselves. But some are of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that this Form of Government cou'd not be settled and lasting among them, since it was so insuitable to the Humours of the Kings who erected Pyramids. Above all this is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark'd, that if things were in that posture; the Regulation of <hi>Joseph</hi> was quite abolish'd, which declar'd the King to be the only Lord of the Land.</p>
                  <p n="47">47. The People were possess'd with a blind and furious superstition towards <hi>Cows, Sheep, Dogs, Cats, Storks, Rats, Haulks, Eagles, Goats, Wolves, Crocodiles, Garden Herbs,</hi> with such kind of things: Which at first view, has such a horrible Aspect, that it seems inconsistent with Prudence, if not with common Reason; for let their pretences be what they will, there
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:136207:47"/> is not the least Colour of Reason to be alledg'd for such a Custom; which any Man indow'd with the common Light of Nature would readily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce to be the effect of Madness.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. WHen the Inhabitants of this Country came under one common Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they were first call'd <hi>Grecians,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Hellenes,</hi> both Names being borrow'd from the People of <hi>Thessaly.</hi> For the <hi>Thessalians,</hi> formerly call'd <hi>Graeci</hi> or <hi>Vetusti,</hi> were Sirnam'd <hi>Hellenes,</hi> from <hi>Hellen</hi> the Son of <hi>Deucalion</hi> that govern'd them. The Sirname was so agreeable to all the People, that they neglected the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Name, tho' it was chiefly known among all the neighbouring Nations; and <hi>Callimachus, Sophocles</hi> and other Poets did not Scruple to make use of it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The first <hi>Grecians</hi> follow'd a wand'ring un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setl'd way of living, preying upon one another in Mutual Robberies. They did no memorable Action before the <hi>Trojan</hi> War. A little before that time <hi>Minos</hi> clear'd the Seas from Pirates,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:136207:48"/> whereupon they began to Build Cities both in the <hi>Isles</hi> and the continent, and <hi>Greece</hi> began to rise. But their circumstances were, as yet, so nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, that when they went to <hi>Troy</hi> they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to maintain themselves by Agriculture and plunder; because they wanted the necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry provisions in order to attack the Town.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Their absence was so long that it occasion'd several great Commotions. After the disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly State of their Affairs was redress'd, they fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out <hi>Colonies.</hi> The <hi>Athenians</hi> planted <hi>Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> in <hi>Jonia</hi> and the Islands of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Sea, and the <hi>Peloponnesus</hi> and other Countries in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> and <hi>Sicily;</hi> and Tyrannical Governments were establish'd every where. The <hi>Corinthians</hi> were first famous for naval Force, after them the <hi>Ioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Polycrates</hi> Tyrant of <hi>Samos,</hi> and others. They engag'd in no memorable Land Battel, till they embark'd in the difference between the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Chalcis</hi> and those of <hi>Eretria.</hi> In this whole circle of Time they scarce had any Laws; Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <hi>Homer</hi> who never so much as mentions the Word.

There were 8 others who interven'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and <hi>Corax,</hi> who died without Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: Upon which occasion <hi>Epopeus</hi> King of <hi>Thessaly</hi> possess'd himself of the Kingdom. This Prince ravish'd <hi>Antiope,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Nycteus</hi> King of the <hi>Thebans;</hi> whereupon a War en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su'd, in which both the Kings were mortally wounded. Then the Kingdom came into the hands of <hi>Lamedon,</hi> Brother to <hi>Corax,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd <hi>Antiope</hi> to the <hi>Thebans. Antiope,</hi> upon her Journey, brought forth Twins; namely, <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phion</hi> and <hi>Zethus,</hi> who were found by a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd and brought up. <hi>Amphion,</hi> a famous Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician, and <hi>Zethus</hi> who was bred a Shepherd, did afterwards resent the Affront done to their Mother.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Lamedon</hi> being engag'd in a War, sent for <hi>Sicyon</hi> the Son of <hi>Metion,</hi> and Grandchild to <hi>Erechtheus</hi> by his Daughter <hi>Attica,</hi> whom he made his Son-in-law and Successor. From him the City was called <hi>Sicyon,</hi> and the Country <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyonia.</hi> He was follow'd in order by 8 Kings;
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:136207:49"/> and then, the Kingdom having stood 962 years, the Priests of <hi>Apollo Carnius,</hi> as some will have it, became Masters of the Government. But <hi>Pausanias</hi> writes, that, in the Reign of <hi>Lacesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> Son to <hi>Hippolytus</hi> at <hi>Sicyon, Temenus</hi> the Son of <hi>Phalx,</hi> who had been King of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives,</hi> surpriz'd the Town with the <hi>Dorians</hi> in the night-time. But by reason that they were both descended of the <hi>Heraclidae,</hi> made him joint Partner in the Government. By this means the <hi>Sicyonians</hi> became <hi>Dorians,</hi> and were reckon'd as part of the <hi>Argives,</hi> in the 871st Year before the Destruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> the 120th before the first Olympiad, A. M. 2908.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. THis Kingdom had always the second, if not the first Rank in Antiquity.

The <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>golick</hi> Bay lies near the <hi>Scyllean</hi> Promontory and <hi>Myrtoan</hi> Sea; near to that was the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try <hi>Argos</hi> and <hi>Mycene</hi> built long after, the Rivers <hi>Inachus</hi> and <hi>Erasinus,</hi> and part of <hi>Laconia.</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Inachus</hi> was the first who began to Reign here, about 244 years after the Date of the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyoman</hi> Kingdom, 142 Years after <hi>Abraham,</hi> 676 Years before the Destruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> 1082 be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the first Olympiad, A.

                        <pb n="75" facs="tcp:136207:49"/> his Sister and Wife bore to him <hi>Phoroneus</hi> and a Daughter <hi>Io,</hi> which is not to be confounded with <hi>Io</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Jasus,</hi> as the Mytho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logists do. After 50 Years <hi>Inachus</hi> died, and <hi>Phoroneus</hi> succeeded him.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Some took <hi>Phoroneus</hi> for the first of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, the Son of the River <hi>Inachus,</hi> and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Father of the Human Race; and the Town into which he gather'd the dispers'd Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was call'd <hi>Phoronicum</hi> from him. He Made himself Master of the whole Peninsula, and by the Nymph <hi>Laodice</hi> begat a Son call'd <hi>Apis,</hi> and <hi>Niobe</hi> his Daughter, who is said to be the first Woman that <hi>Jupiter</hi> lov'd, with whom he begat <hi>Argus. Phoronaeus</hi> reign'd 60 Years and then died.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Apis</hi> his Son and Successor had a mind to Christen the Peninsule by his own Name.

Others say he went into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and was worship'd there as a God under the Name of <hi>Serapis:</hi> But there were several Kings of that Name, whom the Mythologists confound. <hi>Argus</hi> the Son of <hi>Niobe</hi> by <hi>Jupiter</hi> succeeded. At that time <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> reign'd in <hi>Crete.</hi> But since many Kings were call'd by that Name, and by that means it became liable to Ambiguity; I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore oblige the Young Historian with a short Account of the matter.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Ham</hi> the Son of <hi>Noah</hi> was the first who was so call'd after his Death, being worship'd as God under the Title of <hi>Jupiter Hammon.</hi> His Grandchild <hi>Nimrod,</hi> the first King of <hi>Babylon</hi>
                        <pb n="76" facs="tcp:136207:50"/> and <hi>Assyria,</hi> was called <hi>Belus,</hi> and <hi>Jupiter Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</hi> In ancient Times there reign'd a King in <hi>Crete,</hi> who was brought up by the <hi>Curetes,</hi> or <hi>Idaei Dactyli;</hi> and about 150 Years after another of the same Name reign'd in the same Island, who was the first <hi>Jupiter</hi> that was given to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, whence <hi>Niobe</hi> was said to be the first Woman that <hi>Jupiter</hi> lov'd.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Aeolus</hi> the Son of <hi>Deucalion</hi> was so noted by his Posterity, that he was call'd <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Neptune.

The Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents had likewise a Custom of calling the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entest of their Kings <hi>Saturn,</hi> his Eldest Son <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> and the strongest of his Grandchildren <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules.</hi> It is also to be observ'd, that the Illegal Issue of any Noble Woman was commonly laid to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and sometimes to <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo.</hi>

                     <p n="7">7. The Town <hi>Argos</hi> was so call'd from <hi>Argus,</hi> as the Inhabitants were Christen'd <hi>Argi</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givi,</hi> and the Peninsule <hi>Argos.</hi> In his Reign <hi>Greece</hi> began to have Corn of its own, by virtue of their own Agriculture, the Seed being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from abroad. Upon which Account <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> after his Death, was accounted a God, and honour'd with a Temple and Sacrifices. During his Reign, and in the times preceding that, that Honour was engross'd by a private Man call'd <hi>Homogyrus,</hi> as being, the first who yok'd Oxen to the Plough. <hi>Argus</hi> had a Brother call'd <hi>Pelas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> (the Father of <hi>Lycaon</hi>) from whom sprung
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:136207:50"/> the <hi>Pelasgi,</hi> who first inhabited <hi>Arcadia,</hi> from them call'd <hi>Pelasgia,</hi> and afterwards planted Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies in several other Countries.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>Argus</hi> had four Sons by <hi>Evadne</hi> the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Strymon,</hi> namely, <hi>Jasus, Peiranthus, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daurus,</hi> and <hi>Criasus;</hi> to which number <hi>Pausani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> adds <hi>Phorbas. Peiranthus</hi> (or <hi>Pirasus</hi>) was the first who consecrated a Temple to <hi>Juno,</hi> and appointed his own Daughter <hi>Callithya,</hi> or <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirrhoe,</hi> or <hi>Io,</hi> to be Priestess; and the Women of that Order became so famous, that the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> measur'd their Publick Account of Times by the Years of their Priesthood. <hi>Pausanias</hi> is the only Man that says <hi>Pirasus</hi> came to the Crown; but others say <hi>Criasus</hi> succeeded to <hi>Argus,</hi> then <hi>Phorbas,</hi> and after him <hi>Triopas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Pausanias</hi> writes, that <hi>Triopas</hi> had two Sons, <hi>Jasus</hi> and <hi>Agenor;</hi> and that <hi>Jasus</hi> was King of the <hi>Argivans;</hi> tho' <hi>Eusebius</hi> leaves him out in the List of their Kings. The Daughter of this Prince was the famous <hi>Io,</hi> who is said to be ravish'd by <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and thereupon to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd thro' <hi>Juno</hi>'s Envy; and in passing the <hi>Thracian</hi> Streight Christen'd it <hi>Bosphorus.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards she went into <hi>Egypt,</hi> recover'd her Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Shape, bore <hi>Epaphus</hi> the Builder of <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phis,</hi> and was worship'd as a Goddess under the Name of <hi>Isis. Herodotus</hi> writes, that this Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was ravish'd by <hi>Phaenician</hi> Merchants, and that <hi>that</hi> was the occasion of the Feud between the People of <hi>Greece</hi> and those of <hi>Asia;</hi> but at the same time he confounds her with the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Inachus.</hi>

                        <pb n="78" facs="tcp:136207:51"/>10. The Town was call'd <hi>Jasos,</hi> and the Citizens <hi>Jasii,</hi> from <hi>Jasus.</hi> To him succeeded <hi>Crotopus,</hi> his Brother <hi>Agenor</hi>'s Son; whom o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wou'd have to succeed to <hi>Triopas</hi> his Grandfather. His Daughter <hi>Psamathe</hi> being got with Child by <hi>Apollo,</hi> laid out the Infant <hi>Linus.</hi> Upon the Discovery of this matter, her Father put her to Death: Which <hi>Apollo</hi> resented so much that he punish'd the <hi>Argivans</hi> with a Plague; and they, to pacifie him, appointed an anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Mourning for the Child. This Child is not the same, as some have imagin'd, with the famous Poet <hi>Linus.</hi> After 21 Years <hi>Crotopus</hi> was succeeded by <hi>Sthenelas,</hi> and after 11 Years he was follow'd by <hi>Gelanor,</hi> his Son.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. In the Reign of <hi>Gelanor, Danus</hi> the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Aegyptus</hi> came to <hi>Argos,</hi> to make good his claim to the Kingdom, as descending from <hi>Epaphus;</hi> and the People sided with him. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naus</hi> had 50 Daughters, and his Brother had as many Sons; but the former was afraid to give his Daughters to them in Marriage, being fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn'd by the Oracle to beware of his Son-in-Law; and thereupon absented from his own Country. But <hi>Aegyptus,</hi> fearing that his Brother might make too great Alliances by the Marriages of his Daughters, dispatch'd his Sons with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to <hi>Argos,</hi> with orders either to Marry the Girles, or kill their Father.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. <hi>Danaus</hi> seem'd to comply with his Brothers demands; but underhand provided a Dagger for each of his Daughters, and order'd 'em to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their respective Husbands the first Night: which accordingly they all did, excepting <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permnestra,</hi> and as some say <hi>Bebryce. Hyperm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestra</hi>
                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:136207:51"/> was charg'd by her Father with the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of her Duty, and brought to a Tryal; but the <hi>Argives</hi> clear'd her. The rest by so black a Crime as parricide drew upon themselves eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Disgrace, and, as the Story goes, were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd in Hell to fill a leaky Vessel with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which let out as it receiv▪d.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. From <hi>Danaus</hi> the Citizens were call'd <hi>Danai,</hi> instead of <hi>Pelasgians.</hi> 'Tis thought he built the Castle. Having reign'd 50 Years he was follow'd by <hi>Lynceus</hi> his Nephew and Son in Law, Husband to <hi>Hypermnestra. Lynceus</hi>'s Successor was <hi>Abas,</hi> to whom <hi>Ocalea</hi> bore Twins, namely <hi>Acrisius</hi> and <hi>Proetus.</hi> The Story has it, that these two struggled for Preference in the Womb. However, they Disputed the Kingdom with one another. Oftentimes they attack'd one another by open force, and, 'tis said, they were the first that Fought with Shields. At last they came to a Composition, and the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was equally divided. <hi>Arisius</hi> got <hi>Argos;</hi> and <hi>Proetus</hi> got <hi>Hiraeum, Meda, Tiryns</hi> and the Seacoasts. And thus was the Kingdom of the <hi>Argives</hi> split into two parts.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. <hi>Acrisius</hi> Marry'd <hi>Eurydice,</hi> and by her had <hi>Danae,</hi> whom he shut up in a Tower toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with her Nurse, because the Oracle foretold him that his Grandchild would certainly be the Author of his Ruine. But <hi>Jupiter,</hi> transform'd into a Golden Shower, got in to her and begat <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seus.</hi> When she was deliver'd of the Child, she and the Infant were put into a Chest and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Sea; but they were drove upon the Island <hi>Seryphus,</hi> where <hi>Dictys</hi> sav'd and brought up <hi>Perseus. Perseus</hi> was the first <hi>Grecian</hi> Wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:136207:52"/> and did many noble Exploits, He defeated and kill'd <hi>Medusa Gorgon</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> who liv'd upon the Lake <hi>Triton.</hi> Now History mentions three <hi>Gorgons,</hi> namely, <hi>Medu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa, Steno,</hi> and <hi>Euryale,</hi> the Daughters of <hi>Orcus</hi> and a Sea-monster.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. <hi>Perseus</hi> Married <hi>Andromeda</hi> the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Cepheus</hi> by <hi>Cassiopeia,</hi> after he had snatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her out of the Jaws of a Whale. At length when he was in <hi>Pelasgia,</hi> or <hi>Thessaly</hi> so call'd by the <hi>Pelasgians</hi> a Wandring and Vagabond People, he invented the Game of the Quoit; and while <hi>Teutamias</hi> King of the <hi>Larisseans</hi> was Celebrating Games to the Honour of his deceas'd Father, he unfortunately threw a Quoit that kill'd his Grandfather <hi>Acrisius.</hi> Some think that the Council of the <hi>Amphictyones,</hi> which commonly met at <hi>Delphi,</hi> was rather ordain'd by <hi>Acrisius,</hi> than by <hi>Amphictyon</hi> the Son of <hi>Deucalion,</hi> who Reign'd in <hi>Athens</hi> 100 Years before.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. But 'tis not improbable that <hi>Amphictyon</hi> first ordain'd that Council to meet at the <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mopylae,</hi> and that <hi>Acrisius</hi> Translated it from thence to <hi>Delphi.</hi> This place was reckon'd the Center of <hi>Greece,</hi> and of <hi>Europe.</hi> It was the Seat of that famous Oracle of <hi>Apollo Pythius;</hi> and of the Publick and Universal Council of <hi>Greece</hi> which met twice a Year, to adjust dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences between the Cities of <hi>Greece;</hi> and which consisted of certain Commissioners, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Pylagorae,</hi> delegated by each City. This Council continued long in its primitive consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, till <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> cut off the <hi>Phocians</hi> from Voting, and join'd them to his
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:136207:52"/> own Kingdom. A long time after that <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> made some Alterations in it; and in the Reign of <hi>Antoninus Pius</hi> it still had a being and consisted then of 30 Members.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. <hi>Perseus</hi> return'd to <hi>Argos,</hi> to avoid the discreditable Imputation of Parricide: and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded <hi>Megapenthes</hi> the Son of <hi>Praetus</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change Kingdoms with him. After that he built <hi>Mycenae,</hi> so call'd, because in that Place the Head of the Handle of his Sword fell off. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seus</hi> had 5 Sons by <hi>Andromeda,</hi> namely, <hi>Perses, Alcaeus, Sthenelus, Electryon and Mestor.</hi> The credulous <hi>Grecians</hi> perswaded themselves, that <hi>Perses</hi> gave Being to the <hi>Persians.

                     </p>

                     <p n="19">19. <hi>Bias</hi> was follow'd by 5 Successors in a direct Line, till the Days of <hi>Cyanippus,</hi> Son to <hi>Aegialeus,</hi> who descended, all of 'em, from <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leus</hi> by the Mother's side. <hi>Melampus</hi> had six direct Successors for as many Ages, till the Reign

                     <p n="20">20.

After the destruction of <hi>Troy Amphilochus</hi> went into that Country, and the People were christen'd <hi>Amphilochi</hi> after him, and about the same time <hi>Cyanippus</hi> dy'd without Children: So that <hi>Cyla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabes</hi> the Son of <hi>Sthenelus</hi> got the Kingdom to himself. <hi>Cylarabes</hi> likewise dy'd without issue: Whereupon <hi>Orestes</hi> the Son of <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing outted of his Fathers Kingdom, possess'd himself of the Kingdom of the <hi>Argives</hi> and then of that of <hi>Sparta:</hi> of which more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non.</p>

                     <p n="23">23. <hi>Cicero</hi> says there were 6 of that Name: The first and ancientest begot of the first <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Lepitus,</hi> who, they say, disputed with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo</hi> for the Tripos: The second begot of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> who, they say, contemn'd the <hi>Phrygian</hi> Letters: The third <hi>Indigetes</hi> sprung from the <hi>Ideans,</hi> to whom they offer'd Sacrifices for the Dead. The fourth Son to <hi>Asteria</hi> Sister to <hi>Latona,</hi> whom the <hi>Tyrians</hi> worship'd very religiously, taking <hi>Carthago</hi> to be his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: The fifth call'd <hi>Belus</hi> in <hi>India:</hi> And the last the Son of <hi>Alcmena.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="24">24. <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> says there were 3 <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi>'s, <hi>Servius</hi> mentions 4, and <hi>Varro</hi> recounts 44. <hi>Tacitus</hi> writes that the <hi>Lybians</hi> said the Ancientest <hi>Hercules</hi> was born in their Country, and those who equall'd him in great exploits were honour'd with his Sirname. It is likewise to be remember'd, what the Author of the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivoca</hi> commonly ascrib'd to <hi>Xenophon</hi> observes; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Ancientst Kings of noble Families were wont to be call'd <hi>Saturns,</hi> their eldest Sons <hi>Jupiters,</hi> and the bravest of their Grandchildren <hi>Hercules</hi>'s.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. Among all these, he who carry'd the Club and the Hides of Lyons, who kill'd Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and, as the Story has it, assisted the Gods against the Giants; is rather to be reckon'd an <hi>Egyptian,</hi> than to be that <hi>Grecian</hi> who preceded the <hi>Trojan</hi> War by one Generation. But he who erected the Pillars upon the outermost Boundaries of the World, was certainly a <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> the leader of those <hi>Phenicians</hi> who made
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:136207:54"/> an irruption into <hi>Spain</hi> as far as <hi>Gades.</hi> And the Ambitious Plea of the <hi>Grecians</hi> is sufficiently baffl'd by this one remark, that in that Island of <hi>Gades</hi> there stood a most Ancient Temple, in which <hi>Hercules</hi> was worship'd in the <hi>Tyrian,</hi> and not in the <hi>Grecian</hi> way.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. <hi>Sanchoniathon</hi> the Ancientest Writer of the <hi>Phenician</hi> Annals, writes that this <hi>Hercules</hi> was the Son of <hi>Demacoon,</hi> and that his proper Name was <hi>Melcarthus,</hi> which signifies King of the City, the <hi>Grecians</hi> calling him <hi>Melicertes</hi> and <hi>Palaemon.</hi> In his own Country he was likewise call'd <hi>Diodas</hi> as being invok'd by Lovers.

                     <p n="35">35. After the Death of <hi>Eurystheus, Atreus</hi> having master'd all the <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> put the <hi>Heraclidae</hi> to flight.

Soon after he himself became a proper object of the like Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement in the Island <hi>Melos</hi> upon his return from <hi>Troy.</hi>
                     </p>

He was educated by <hi>Elpenor</hi> the Son of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> together with his Brother <hi>Achames. Demophon</hi> snatch'd the image of <hi>Pallas</hi> from the <hi>Argives,</hi> who upon their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from <hi>Troy</hi> were forc'd in by a Storm upon the Coast of <hi>Attica.</hi> After 34 Years he left the Kingdom to his Son <hi>Oxyntas,</hi> who after 22 Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions was follow'd by <hi>Aphidas.</hi> He having reign'd one Year was follow'd by <hi>Thymoetes</hi> the 15th King, who, being a bastard, is said to have kill'd his Brother <hi>Aphidas.</hi> After 8 Years this Prince lost his Kingdom, and concludes the List of the Kings of <hi>Erechtheus</hi>'s Posterity.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. There arose a difference between the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> and <hi>Baeotians</hi> about <hi>Caelenae</hi> which lay in their neighborhood. And 'twas mutually agreed upon that the two Kings should decide the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a Duel.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:136207:63"/> Messenius,</hi> whom he <hi>Heraclidoe</hi> had expell'd his own Country, takes up the Quarrel; and by a Stratagem defeats <hi>Xanthus</hi> the King of the <hi>Baeotians.</hi> By which means he obtain'd the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Athens,</hi> by way of reward. After <hi>Melanthius</hi> his Son <hi>Codrus</hi> succeeded, who was the last King of <hi>Athens.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="24">24. The <hi>Heraclidae</hi> being engag'd in a War with the <hi>Athenians,</hi> were advis'd by the Oracle, that the only way to obtain a Conquest was to avoid hurting the King of their Enemies. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drus</hi> knowing this, put on the Habit of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Soldier, and expos'd himself where the Action was hottest, and was kill'd. Upon the news of his Death the <hi>Heraclidae</hi> broke up the Siege and march'd off, tho' some of their Army had already enter'd the Town, whom the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> sent safe home. The Death of <hi>Codrus</hi> happen'd 486 Years after <hi>Cecrops,</hi> 114 Years after the destruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> 35 Years after the return of the <hi>Heraclidae,</hi> 293 Years before the first Olympiad, A.

                     <p n="25">25. After <hi>Codrus</hi> there was no King at <hi>Athens.</hi> The adminstration was then put into the Hands of the <hi>Archontes,</hi> who possess'd the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Life, their Power being lessen'd and Subject to the People. <hi>Medon</hi> the Son of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drus</hi> was the first <hi>Archon;</hi> tho' he was bred up in hopes of being King. <hi>Nileus</hi> his Brother was very troublesome to him. He refus'd to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey <hi>Medon</hi> whose Government was lame and maim'd. But at last the Affair was remitted to the <hi>Delphick</hi> Oracle, which made answer, that the Government of the <hi>Athenians</hi> belong'd to <hi>Medon.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="104" facs="tcp:136207:64"/>26. After that <hi>Nileus</hi> and the other Sons of <hi>Codrus</hi> were sent into a <hi>Colony,</hi> and carried with them both a great number of <hi>Athenians</hi> that listed themselves under their conduct, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Body of <hi>Jonians.</hi> This Colony was likewise enlarged by the <hi>Thebans,</hi> the <hi>Minyae</hi> from among the <hi>Orchomenians,</hi> the <hi>Phocians</hi> bating those of <hi>Delphi,</hi> and some <hi>Aebantes</hi> out of <hi>Eubaea.</hi> This Colony built the twelve <hi>Jonian</hi> Cities in <hi>Asia,</hi> namely, <hi>Miletus, Ephesus, Priene, Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon, Myus, Teos, Lebedos, Clazomenae, Ery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrae, Phocaea, Chius,</hi> and <hi>Samus;</hi> the Original of which Cities is accounted for at large by <hi>Pausa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="27">27. <hi>Medon</hi> was follow'd by twelve successive Princes in the space of 15 Years, who were call'd <hi>Medontidae</hi> from him. The last of these was <hi>Alcmaeon</hi> the Son of <hi>Aeschilus,</hi> who died be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the end of the Second Year of his Reign. Then the People being uneasy under the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Power of the <hi>Archontes,</hi> confin'd it to the compass of ten Years. This change was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree'd about the beginning of the Olympiads. And <hi>Charops</hi> was the first who was invested with this ten Years Government. That form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment lasted 70 Years. The last of that sort of <hi>Archontes</hi> was <hi>Erixias,</hi> who, after a six Years Reign, either died or was degraded; and then the Republick put on a new Face.</p>
                     <p n="28">28. For the People being proud of their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and possess'd with an insatiable itch for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, did quite abrogate the Monarchical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, and put the administration of Affairs into the Hands of 9 <hi>Archontes,</hi> to be elected yearly. The first of these was President and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:136207:64"/> call'd <hi>Eponymus.</hi> The second was call'd King; being Judge of all Civil and Criminal Causes. The third was <hi>Polemarchus,</hi> the Supream Judge of Military Affairs. The other six were call'd <hi>Thesmothetae,</hi> or Defenders of their Laws and Customs. The whole Body of the Nine, joyn'd together, had Power to call a Meeting of the People, and propose their Opinion in matters of importance, as the Kings and <hi>Archontes</hi> did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                     <p n="29">29. So great was that superstructure of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they rear'd up upon the Foundation that <hi>Theseus</hi> laid. But the People having once the Reins in their own Hands, did not know where to stop or fix. The Harangues of popular Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors turn'd and toss'd 'em to and again, as the Winds do the Sea. The Power of the Nobility was mightily wrong'd, especially by this, that the Sentences of the Judges were look'd upon as Laws, there being no certain Statutes, as yet, to walk by. About 50 Years after, a complaint was given in upon this Head, which seem'd to carry justice along with it: Whereupon they employ'd one <hi>Draco</hi> a prudent and good, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Stanch, Man, to make Laws for 'em.</p>
                     <p n="30">30. He abrogated many Laws, and reform'd the Court of the <hi>Ephetae,</hi> which was order'd to consist of 51 Members, each of 'em 50 Years Old and upwards. But the Laws were so bloody, as entailing Death to every slight Crime, that the Common People who were drown'd in debt became turbulent and daring, and their divisions and Animosities rose to a dismal Degree. At last all their hopes were pointed upon <hi>Solon</hi> a Man of Prudence and known Integrity. They
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:136207:65"/> intreated him to act the Part of a Physician to the Republick. And in order to furnish him with suitable Power for that end, of their own accord offer'd him a tyrannical Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p n="31">31. Tho <hi>Solon</hi> was sensible that he had ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated himself with the People, by the Fame of his Wisdom, and the Stratagems with which he recover'd the Island <hi>Salamina;</hi> yet he had no mind to meddle with the Government. He dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Avarice of the Poor, and the Pride of the Rich. He down-right refus'd to be Tyrant. But his Friends chid him mightily for so doing, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging him with the Folly of standing out meerly for the Name's sake, since his Vertue could easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convert a Tyranny to a moderate Government, as <hi>Tynnonidas</hi> had lately done in <hi>Euboea,</hi> and <hi>Pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacus</hi> in <hi>Mytilene.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="32">32. But no such Offer could prevail with <hi>Solon</hi> to depart from his concerted Measures. 'Tis said, he answer'd his Friends, <hi>That Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was a tempting thing, but there was no end on't.</hi> At last he took upon him the offer'd charge of setting the Government to rights; but before he set about it, he enacted a general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Debts, call'd <hi>Sisachthea,</hi> by which means he ingratiated himself into the Affection of all Parties. He was elected Prince and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chon,</hi> immediately after <hi>Philombrotus;</hi> and his first business was to abrogat all the Laws of <hi>Draco,</hi> together with those of Murder, which provided severe and disproportion'd Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                     <p n="33">33. Then he review'd the People, and drew them up in 4 Tribes; allotting Offices to every
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:136207:65"/> one suitable to their Station. The poorer sort being excluded from the Magistracy; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd only to have a Place in the Meetings. And in order to curb the growing Power of the <hi>Plebs,</hi> he instituted a Senat, besides that of the <hi>Areopagites,</hi> consisting of 400 Members, (that is, 100 out of each Tribe) which was to form and moderat the general Conventions, and to examin and judge of all things belonging to the People. Their Decrees were to be look'd upon as defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, if the matter was only of small Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; but if it was a business of great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they were to be remitted to the Censure of the People.</p>
                     <p n="34">34. Tho' the Power of the Society of the 9 <hi>Archontes</hi> was much empair'd, yet he allotted them the same Offices as they had perform'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with the addition of a more solemn Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a Reward for their good Services, after a severe Tryal before the <hi>Areopagites.</hi> For he suppos'd the Senat of the <hi>Areopagites</hi> to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable and of untainted integrity; and invested them with the Supream Authority in the City; and with a right to inspect and censure the Lives and Conversations of the Citizens, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally those of the Younger Form.</p>
                     <p n="35">35. He gave the general Conventions of the People, Power to make Peace and War, to send out Ambassadors, and to naturalife Forreigners. The Place of their Meeting was either the <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> or a Place of Judicature just by, call'd <hi>Pnyx;</hi> and sometimes the Theater of <hi>Bacchus.</hi> The set time of sitting; was three Days, to be renew'd after every 35 Days. The extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:136207:66"/> times were determin'd, by occasional Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences. The ordinary Convocations were call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the extraordinary were call'd <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>.</p>
                     <p n="36">36. There were several Courts for Law-suits, besides that of the <hi>Areopagi.</hi> The most remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able was that of the <hi>Ephetae</hi> instituted by <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoon</hi> the Son of <hi>Theseus:</hi> The next was that of the <hi>Heliastae,</hi> so call'd from sitting in an open place, which consisted of 500 or 1000 and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times 1500 Members, chosen by Lot, all of 'em being above 30 Years Old. There was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a Court of Arbiters, to whom 220 Men chosen equally out of the Tribes were join'd; and they took Cognisance of Affairs belonging to the Tribes. Besides a Court of 30, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards 40 Members, which went round the Tribes, and determined their differences about small Summs of Mony and triffling concerns.</p>
                     <p n="37">37. After <hi>Solon</hi> had made an end of his task, he obtain'd leave of the <hi>Athenians</hi> to Travel for 10 Years, in order to avoid the calumnies and reproaches of the Citizens: Thinking that in 10 Years time they would be tam'd and inur'd to the Laws. But upon his departure, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty split into divers Factions; as they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally do when over grown in Power. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> Headed the <hi>Pediaei, Magacles,</hi> the Son of <hi>Alcmae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> the <hi>Paralii,</hi> and <hi>Pisistratus</hi> the <hi>Diacrii,</hi> who were joyn'd by a body of Hirelins that hated the Richer sort. Tho' the Laws continu'd still in Force, yet the People were all in a Ferment, and eager for changing the Form of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; for every Party made account, that by a Revolution they would advance themselves.</p>
                     <p n="38">
                        <pb n="109" facs="tcp:136207:66"/>38. When Affairs were at this Pass, <hi>Solon</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd, and endeavour'd to bring the Factions to an Accommodation by separate Interviews with their respective Heads. <hi>Pisistratus</hi> seem'd to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten to his Proposals. He was a fair spoken Man, Proud of assisting the Poor, moderate in Revenge, and one that glory'd in having such qualities as Nature had denied him. <hi>Solon</hi> saw thro' the Humour and deceit of the Man, and endeavour'd to reclaim him.</p>
                     <p n="39">39. But <hi>Pisistratus</hi> had insinuated himself so much into the Affections of the People, that he expected to be made King, and contemn'd all the Remonstrances that were offer'd to him. At last he wounded himself in two places, and expos'd himself thus wounded in a Chariot riding along the Streets, as if his Enemies had laid wait for him and treated him in that fashion. By this Stratagem, notwithstanding all <hi>Solon's</hi> Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strances to the contrary, he got the People to make a Law empowering him to hire and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain 50 Men to Guard his Person. By the means of these his Guards he possess'd himself of the Castle, and usurp'd the Government.</p>
                     <p n="40">40. He sat at the Helm of Affairs three Years: At the end of which <hi>Megacles</hi> and <hi>Lycurgus</hi> conspir'd against him, and expell'd him. But afterwards the Conspirators disagreed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves; whereupon <hi>Megacles</hi> brought him back upon the Condition that he should Marry his Daughter. The Stratagem by which he was restor'd was truely Comical. There was a strapping Handsome Woman, in the Tribe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Paeaniaea,</hi> whose name was <hi>Phya:</hi> She was fout Cubits high.</p>
                     <p n="41">
                        <pb n="110" facs="tcp:136207:67"/>41. This Woman was set out with all sorts of Armour, and plac'd in a Coach, in a very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Habit. In this fashion she rode thro' the City, with some <hi>Athenians</hi> going before her, and calling upon the People to give a welcome Reception to <hi>Pisistratus,</hi> whom <hi>Minerva</hi> her self honour'd above all Men, and was then Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting to her own Palace. By this means the Report was spread among the Tribes that <hi>Pisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratus</hi> was brought back by <hi>Minerva:</hi> And those who were in the Town, being perswaded that 'twas the Goddess her self; fell down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Woman and receiv'd <hi>Pisistratus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="42">42. <hi>Pisistratus</hi> being thus restor'd, married the Daughter of <hi>Megacles</hi> pursuant to his Promise. His Wife after some time complain'd that her Husband us'd her unkindly: Wherupon <hi>Megacles</hi> her Father was again incens'd against him: And in short, things were brought to that pass, that he was oblig'd to retire to <hi>Eretia,</hi> in the Tenth Year after his Restoration to the Government of <hi>Athens.</hi> He continued in Exile other Ten Years without attempting any thing. But at the end of them, his Son <hi>Hippias</hi> push'd him on to Enterprise something. Accordingly he Hires some <hi>Theban</hi> and <hi>Argivan</hi> Troops, masters <hi>Marathon,</hi> routs the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and Possesses himself of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> without much opposition. Being thus a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time restor'd to his Government, he Fortifi'd himself in it, only by making Friends and Allian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, making it his Business to gather up Summs of Money, and by taking up his Enemies Sons as Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stages.</p>
                     <p n="43">43. For the <hi>Athenians</hi> could charge <hi>Pisistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> with nothing else but the Usurpation of the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:136207:67"/> Government. They felt no other Yoak, but that of thwarting their Humour which could not brook a Monarchical Government. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted no Tribute, but the Tythes that the Kings us'd always to have. He put none to Death; he Banish't none; he turn'd no Man out of his Estate; and gave Affronts to no Person. He left the Laws of <hi>Solon,</hi> and the order of the Magistracy unviolated; and tho' <hi>Solon</hi> was his Enemy, yet he Honour'd and Respected him in a distinguishing manner.</p>
                     <p n="44">44. He was both Learn'd, and did considerable Service to the World of Learning. He was the first Institutor of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Library, and drew up the scatter'd Poems of <hi>Homer,</hi> in the order they now appear in. He left the Government to his Sons <hi>Hippias</hi> and <hi>Hipparchus,</hi> who us'd their Power with a great deal of Moderation, and manag'd the Administration of Affairs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably well, till <hi>Hippias</hi> being fretted by the Death of <hi>Hipparchus,</hi> lost his Government. This happen'd in the Reign of <hi>Darius</hi> Son to <hi>Hystaspes,</hi> and therefore will come in more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly elsewhere. <hi>Pisistratus</hi> died at the same time that <hi>Craesus</hi> King of <hi>Lydia</hi> was Conquer'd by <hi>Cyrus</hi> in the 20 Year of the 57 <hi>Olympiad,</hi> A.

However, if they truely descended of the <hi>Achaians,</hi> they had as much, if not more, right to this Country, than the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclidae.</hi> This change of Affairs happen'd, about 8 Years after the taking of <hi>Troy,</hi> according to <hi>Thucydides</hi>'s Computation, 327 Years before the first <hi>Olympiad,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Melanthus</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> A.

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:136207:69"/> only counterfeited an approbation of her Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, and at the bottom detested her Principles. For as soon as the Child came into the World, he resign'd the Government of his own accord, and plac'd it upon the Throne.</p>
                     <p n="9">9.

For the Child's Mother, thinking her self affronted, together with her Relations, bespatter'd him with Calamnious Imputations, as if he had a design upon the Child. This he took very ill; and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the uncertainty of Events, resolved to Travel till his Nephew came of Age▪ and begot an Heir to the Crown. He visited many Places and Countries; and is said to have collected and methodiz'd <hi>Homer's</hi> Verses, and to be the first that brought 'em to <hi>Greece.</hi>

                     <p n="10">10. But the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> did often miss and call upon <hi>Lycurgus</hi> in his absence, for all things ran into Confusion. For the People not only refus'd all allegiance to their Kings, but wanted further to feed an insatiable appetite for Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> being well acquainted with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their Distemper, resolv d first to evacuate and purge the Body, as being foul and stuff'd with all manner of Distempers, and then to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn a new Diet. However being sensible what influence Religion has over Mens Minds, he went to <hi>Delphi;</hi> and it is giv'n out that he fetch'd from thence the <hi>Rhetra,</hi> as a Model for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. He propos'd that the Republick shou'd be govern'd by 2 Kings, that is two nominal Kings,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:136207:70"/> divested of all Majestick Power, uncapable of doing any thing of Moment at home, by reason of their Subjection to the Senate. Abroad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he was allow'd the command of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. The Senate consisted of Elders, 60 Years old and upwards, besides the Kings. This Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate he set in opposition to the Kings, as being a Medium between them and the People, in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to confine both within the Limits of their Duty. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> did not Trouble himself with backing his Laws with Argument; which Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod <hi>Aristotle</hi> finds fault with, as being unsuitable to the Measures of a free Republick, and an inlet to unjust Demands; such as are many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things in <hi>Lycurgus</hi>'s Laws.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Whatever the Kings lost, the People got but little for shifting two Masters for 30. For there was no appeal allow'd from the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Senate and Kings. All the privilege they had was to enact such things as the Kings and Elders propos'd. However, in order to make this form of Government lasting, there was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of sinking the Occasions of Sedition. Now to compass that, it was proper to reduce their Estates to an equal Standard. With which view <hi>Lycurgus</hi> took all their Gold and Silver from 'em, and coin'd Iron Money for 'em.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. He order'd the Citizens to feast together at their Publick Meetings, call'd <hi>Andria, Phydi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> and <hi>Scyssitia.</hi> He order'd the Boys to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducated and instructed upon the publick Charge, under the Hands of the <hi>Paedonomi</hi> and <hi>Irenes.</hi> And as they were to be exercis'd in harsh and dangerous Adventures; so he order'd the Girles to be exercis'd in running, wrestling, throwing of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:136207:70"/> Coits and Darts; and in effect remov'd all the wonted Tenderness and softness that us'd to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Education of Women.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. In order to put a stop to Luxury and the Inundations of Vice, he prohibited any Man to Travel; and all those who repair'd to <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> without some good and useful Errand, were expell'd the City. He would not have the Town to be surrounded by Walls, as taking the Valor and Watchfulness of the Citizens, who minded nothing but the good of their Country, to be the Walls and Security of the City. For he would not allow any of 'em to meddle with il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberal Arts. The <hi>Helotae</hi> manur'd the Grounds and pay'd the Landlords the stinted Rents. And that they might not grow too powerful, were sometimes barbarously murder'd by Young Men hid in the Fields; from whence their mutual En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements were call'd <hi>Cryptia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="15">15. But all the thanks <hi>Lycurgus</hi> got, was, to have Stones thrown at him, and to have his Eye knock'd out with the Blow of a Stick. <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> writes, that he was once ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd by the fury of the Mob, and at last ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd his Country. <hi>Plutarch</hi> says, he oblig'd the Kings, Senat and People by Oath, to keep up the same Form of Government till he return'd. For he was then upon a Journey to the Oracle, to consult it with reference to one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Points he had yet to manage.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. The Oracle made answer, that his Laws were well concerted, and that the City would continue its Glory, providing it follow'd <hi>Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>'s Model: Whereupon, according to <hi>Plutarch,</hi> he resolv'd never to free the Citizens from the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:136207:71"/> Obligation of their Oath, and to that end starv'd himself to Death. Some say, he died in <hi>Crete,</hi> and order'd his Body to be burnt and the Ashes to be thrown in the Sea, to the end that the <hi>Spartans</hi> should not gather 'em together, and pretend to free themselves of their Oath by carrying 'em back to <hi>Lacedemon.</hi> But <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> says he starv'd himself to death, because the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> offer'd to introduce new Laws.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. The Republick was then in Peace. But after <hi>Lycurgus</hi>'s Death, it renew'd the War with the <hi>Argives,</hi> and took up Arms against the <hi>Tege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atae</hi> a People of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> and the <hi>Achaians.</hi> The <hi>Tegeatae</hi> took <hi>Charilaus</hi> their King, but quickly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss'd him. That King was follow'd by his Son <hi>Nicander;</hi> and <hi>Teleclus</hi> his Collegue, by <hi>Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes.</hi> In the 34th Year of <hi>Nicander, Iphitus</hi> restor'd the Olympick Games, which were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly celebrated by <hi>Hercules, Pelops, Endymion, Neleus, Peliades, Lycurgus,</hi> and several others.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. After the return of the <hi>Heraclidae, Oxylas</hi> had restor'd 'em, and got <hi>Elis</hi> by his dexterity at 'em. But afterwards they were forgot for 303 Years, till <hi>Iphitus</hi> in the time of the Divisions of <hi>Greece,</hi> being of <hi>Oxylas</hi>'s Posterity, restor'd 'em, upon Advice from the divine Oracle. They were call'd <hi>Olympick</hi> from the City <hi>Olympia,</hi> and were celebrated in the beginning of every fifth Year, at full Moon, in the Month <hi>Hecatombaeon,</hi> a little before the Summer Solstice.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. The <hi>Grecian</hi> Games, consisted of wrestling, running, leaping, throwing of Quoits, and fenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Sticks, that they call'd <hi>Cestus,</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. From these 5 exercises they were call'd <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> and <hi>Quinquertiones.</hi> However 'tis to be remark'd
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:136207:71"/> that <hi>Varro</hi>'s second interval of time ends in this Restoration of the Olympick Games. For he makes three differences of times.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. The first reaches from the Creation of Man to the first Deluge, which he out of ignorance styles <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or <hi>Obscure.</hi> The second goes from the first Deluge to the first <hi>Olympiad,</hi> and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the fabulous Stories with which 'tis stuff'd, is call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or <hi>Fabulous.</hi> The third runs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the first <hi>Olympiad</hi> and his own time, and is call'd <hi>Historical,</hi> because the Transactions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to it are related in true Histories. Now this Restoration of the Olympiads happen'd 408 Years after the taking of <hi>Troy,</hi> 714 before the Christian <hi>Aera,</hi> A. M. 3229.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. In the end of the 7th Olympiad, there happen'd a great Alteration of Affairs in <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> upon the Institution of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> about 130 Years after the commencing of <hi>Lycurgus</hi>'s Laws. The number of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> was 5, to be chosen every Year out of the Commons. <hi>Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> was the first that got that Office. Most wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters say these Officers were first created in the Reign of <hi>Theopompus</hi> Son to <hi>Nicander</hi> and Grandson to <hi>Charilaus.</hi> But we are at a loss to know what was the end of their Institution.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. Many alledge they were appointed for a Ballance to the regal Power. But others say they were created by the K.s themselves, when engag'd in an expedition against the <hi>Messenians;</hi> which oblig'd 'em to nominate some of their Friends to manage Affairs in their absence, and these were call'd <hi>Ephori</hi> from inspecting the Publick Affairs. So that at first they were only the King's Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, but afterwards gradually arrogated to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:136207:72"/> a magistratical Power, when no Body was aware of it. But whatever was the end of their Institution, 'tis certain their Power in a short time became Tyrannical, and put their Kings in danger of their Lives. The President of the Court, who was call'd <hi>Eponymus,</hi> inspected the publick Accounts every Year.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. In the 2d Year of the 9th Olympiad, the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> embarqued in an open War with the <hi>Messenians;</hi> tho' before the Institution of the <hi>Ephori</hi> they had jealousies of one another. For the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> took it very ill, that <hi>Cres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phontes</hi> over-reach'd his Grandsons, and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd himself of the <hi>Messenian</hi> Ground. And their Anger was inflam'd by the Battel fought at <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>'s Temple in the confines of <hi>Messene,</hi> in which <hi>Teleclus</hi> Father to <hi>Alcmenes</hi> then King, was, kill'd. However both sides cry'd out that they were wrong'd.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. At last their mutual hatred broke out into a War, by means of a horrid Piece of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness committed by one <hi>Evaephnus</hi> a <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi> This fellow endeavor'd to cheat <hi>Polychares</hi> the <hi>Messenian,</hi> of some Oxen that were put out to him; and when he found the design was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd, desir'd his Son should be sent to receive their Price, and when he came kill'd him. <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lychares</hi> was justly incens'd at the hainousness of the Action, and demanded that the Criminal should be deliver'd up in order to be punish'd. But finding his Solicitations were not regarded, he slew every <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> he met with.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. Whereupon the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperated, and demanded that <hi>Polychares</hi> should
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:136207:72"/> be brought to condign Punishment. The <hi>Messe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> were divided among themselves; but the Majority carried, that he should be defended by force of Arms, if there was occasion. When the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> heard this, they refus'd to remit the Case to the Judgment of the <hi>Amphyctyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> or <hi>Areopagites,</hi> and prepar'd for an Eepediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, engaging in a mutual Oarh never to return till <hi>Messene</hi> was taken.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. The War was carried on for several Years, with various Success. At last, the <hi>Messenians,</hi> whose Country was the Seat of the War, were mightily put to it, and in fine resolv'd to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don all the Towns that lay remote from the Sea, and to remove to the Mountain <hi>Ithomes.</hi> Upon this removal, there follow'd a cessation of Arms on both sides for some Years. And in the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> wag'd War with the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives,</hi> which had been occasion'd by a dispute concerning <hi>Thyrea</hi> which lay in the confines. Both Parties agreed to leave the matter to the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phictyones,</hi> and their sentence was, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy should be decided by 30 Men on each side, adjudging the rightful Title to the Victors. And indeed the Senate adjudg'd the Victory to the <hi>Lacedemonians;</hi> but the <hi>Argives</hi> pretended they were Victors, and thereupon renew'd the War, but with small Success.</p>
                     <p n="27">27. About 8 Years after the removing to <hi>Itho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,</hi> the <hi>Messenians</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> return'd to their former War, and had several engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with various Success. In the first engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the <hi>Messenians</hi> lost their King <hi>Euphaes,</hi> and chose <hi>Aristodemus</hi> for his Successor: In the second engagement, being fortified by the Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:136207:73"/> Troops from the <hi>Arcadians, Argives</hi> and <hi>Sicyonians,</hi> they had better success; whereupon the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> seem'd to be doubtful of the event; and both the one and the other sent to <hi>Delphi,</hi> to enquire into the event of the War.</p>
                     <p n="28">28. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> observ'd the Orders of the Oracle in doing what it gave for an <hi>Omen</hi> of the Victory; and at last besieg'd the frighted <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senians,</hi> and took the Mountain <hi>Ithomes,</hi> in the end of the 28 Year of the War, in the first Year of the 14th Olympiad, while the <hi>Medontidae</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Decennial Government of <hi>Athens,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> over the Jews, about the same time that the 10 Tribes were carried off in Captivity by the King of <hi>Assyria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="29">29. The Conquerors destroy'd <hi>Ithomes,</hi> and master'd all the other Places of <hi>Messenia,</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd the <hi>Messenians</hi> to manure the Ground, and bring one half of the Fruits every Year to <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demon.</hi> They bound them by an Oath to remain ever true to them, and to appear in Mourning, both Men and Women, at the Funerals of the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Kings.</p>
                     <p n="30">30. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> being yet absent from home, call'd to Mind the Obligation of their Oath, and were much affraid of their future off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring, lest the People should revolt, during the absence of the Husbands from their Wives. Whereupon they sent home 50 of their stoutest young Men, who were so young at the first set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out that they were not engag'd in the Oath, and order'd 'em to lye promiscuously with the Women.</p>
                     <p n="31">31. There Sprung from them an Offspring call'd <hi>Parthenii;</hi> who, when they grew up, were
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:136207:73"/> own'd by none, and had no Heritage allotted them; whereupon they enter'd into a Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy together with the Slaves or <hi>Helotae.</hi> But, the Conspiracy being discover'd, they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd, and as they wander'd in quest of a new Seat happen'd to fix in <hi>Italy,</hi> where they expell'd the <hi>Barbarians</hi> and <hi>Cretians</hi> that liv'd near <hi>Taren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="32">32. The <hi>Messenians</hi> were impatient of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and having no hopes that the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Yoak would become easier, thought it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for them to dye in Battel, than to depart the <hi>Peloponnesus;</hi> whereupon they enter'd into a Conspiracy under the Conduct of <hi>Aristomenes</hi> a Youth of noble Birth. Accordingly, when all things were got in readiness for War, they revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the 39 Year after the overthrow of <hi>Ithomes,</hi> the 4th of the 23 Olympiad in which <hi>Icarus</hi> was Victor, while the yearly Magistrates go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd in <hi>Athens,</hi> and <hi>Tlesias</hi> was <hi>Praetor</hi> or chief <hi>Archon.</hi> A. M. 3320.</p>
                     <p n="33">33. <hi>Aristomenes</hi> being a Man equally admir'd for the accomplishments of his Body and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Mind, govern'd the <hi>Messenians</hi> very happily, and routed the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> oftner than once; so that they began to entertain some Thoughts of Peace; but <hi>Tyrtaeus</hi> the Poet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hing'd their Resolutions by teaching 'em to make up the loss of their Men by recruits of the <hi>Helotae.</hi> For about a Year or two before they had sent to consult the <hi>Delphick</hi> Oracle about the event of the War; and the Goddess made answer, that a Counsellor must be sent for from <hi>Athens.</hi> The <hi>Athenians</hi> being desir'd to give 'em a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor, were indeed unwilling to assist them, but
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:136207:74"/> dreaded to disobey the Oracle; wherefore they sent 'em this <hi>Tyrtaeus,</hi> a Schoolmaster, lame in his Feet, and not over-sound in his intellectuals.</p>
                     <p n="34">34. In the third Year of the War, the <hi>Messeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> being deserted by the Auxiliary Troops of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> were almost totally cut off at <hi>Fossa-magna.</hi> Whereupon, by <hi>Aristomenes</hi>'s advice, they abandon'd all their Towns; excepting <hi>Pylus</hi> and <hi>Methene;</hi> and retir'd to the Mountain <hi>Ira,</hi> where they were soon after block'd up. The Siege lasted 10 Years, till at length <hi>Aristomenes,</hi> who had frequently gall'd the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> in sallying out, was wounded; whereupon the Guards were but carelessly kept, and the Enemy got ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess into <hi>Ira;</hi> but with a very hot engagement, which gave <hi>Aristomenes</hi> the opportunity of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off. Thus the War ended, and the slavery of <hi>Messenians</hi> was compleated in the 16th Year of the War, the first Year of the 28th <hi>Olympiad,</hi> in the <hi>Archonship</hi> of <hi>Autosthenes,</hi> A. M. 3337.</p>
                     <p n="35">35. While the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were pulling <hi>Messenia</hi> to pieces, <hi>Aristomenes</hi> resolv'd to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack <hi>Sparta:</hi> But unfortunatly discover'd the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> and their King, <hi>Aristocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> who formerly had betray'd them at <hi>Fossa-mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> reveal'd it to the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi> By which means <hi>Aristomenes</hi> was indeed baulk'd; but <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocrates</hi> was brought to condign punishment for his perfidy, being ston'd to Death by his own Subjects. Next Spring several <hi>Messenians</hi> sail'd to <hi>Italy,</hi> being invited thither by <hi>Anaxilaus</hi> Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of <hi>Rhegium,</hi> who was a <hi>Messenian</hi> by Birth.</p>
                     <p n="36">36. By advice from <hi>Anaxilaus,</hi> they besige'd <hi>Zancle</hi> a City in <hi>Sicily;</hi> and being at last receiv'd
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:136207:74"/> into the City christen'd it <hi>Messene. Aristomenes</hi> gave his Daughter to the Men of the biggest Character; and soon after went to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> to his Son-in-Law <hi>Demagetus,</hi> where he died. He was a very famous Man, and deserves to be rank'd among those few who liv'd and died in a flourishing and glorious state.</p>
                     <p n="37">37. Such of the <hi>Messenians</hi> as would not leave their Country, were added to the number of the <hi>Helotae,</hi> and oppress'd with the highest degree of Slavery; because they were not so much Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies as Rivals; and the War they had wag'd was not carried on out of any design to affect the Government, but to shew themselves a gallant People. The <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> interest was conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably strengthen'd by the addition of <hi>Messenia</hi> to their Dominions. It continued 200 Years in their Hands, till at length the old Inhabitants return'd. But the return of the <hi>Messenians</hi> and the affairs of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> contemporary to it, must be cast into another Place.</p>

Bellero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phontes</hi> being guilty of Murder, fled to <hi>Argi,</hi> where he was entertain'd by the King <hi>Praetus;</hi> but having deny'd to satisfie the Queen, who courted his Embraces, was charg'd by her with the offering Violence to her; and the King sent him away to <hi>Lycia</hi> to <hi>Iolus</hi> the Queen's Father, with private Orders to the King to make away with his Guest.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Accordingly <hi>Iolas</hi> engag'd him with the Monster <hi>Chimaera,</hi> which he defeated and kill'd, being mounted on <hi>Pegasus.</hi> Then he sent him against the <hi>Solymi</hi> and <hi>Amazons,</hi> whom he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise conquer'd. At last several stout young Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows laid wait for him, whom he likewise kill'd. Whereupon <hi>Iolus</hi> admir'd his Valour, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd his Daughter <hi>Philonoe</hi> to him; and, when he died, made him his Heir. When <hi>Bellerophontes</hi> fled from <hi>Corinth, Thoas</hi> the Son of <hi>Ornytion</hi> got the Kingdom. <hi>Demophoon</hi> succeeded him, and after him <hi>Propodas;</hi> whose two Sons <hi>Doridas</hi> and <hi>Hyanthidas</hi> reign'd jointly, when <hi>Aletes</hi> the Son of <hi>Hippotas,</hi> Grandson to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and Great Grandson to <hi>Hercules,</hi> conquer'd <hi>Corinth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. It is not certain from whence the City was call'd <hi>Corinth;</hi> but thus much we know, that <hi>Aletes</hi> christen'd it <hi>Corinthus Jovis</hi> in Honour of <hi>Jupiter Dodonaeus,</hi> whose Oracle foretold his Accession to the Crown. Hence the vulgar Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple took occasion to boast, that one <hi>Corinthus</hi> the Builder of their City was descended of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter;</hi> and were so proud of the Fancy, that all <hi>Greece</hi> ridicul'd them for it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. After <hi>Aletes,</hi> the Eldest Sons of the <hi>Heraclidae</hi> reign'd for several Ages. The first was <hi>Ixion,</hi>
                        <pb n="127" facs="tcp:136207:75"/> the second <hi>Agelaus,</hi> the third <hi>Prumnis,</hi> the fourth <hi>Bacchis,</hi> whose Posterity were called <hi>Bacchiadae.</hi> He was follow'd by 8 Successors in order, the last of whom, <hi>Automenes,</hi> had reign'd just one Year, when above 200 <hi>Bacchiadae</hi> possess'd themselves of the Kingdom, and continu'd an Aristocratical Government for 90 Years, chusing every Year a <hi>Prytanis</hi> as Superintendant over the rest.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. While the <hi>Bacchiadae</hi> were thus possess'd of the Government, the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were Lords of the Sea, and carry'd a Colony to <hi>Sicily,</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>Archias,</hi> which built the City <hi>Syracusae.</hi> About the same time they sent ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Colony to the Island <hi>Phaeacus,</hi> which built the City of <hi>Corcyra,</hi> from whence the Island de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd its Name.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The <hi>Bacchiadae</hi> admitted no body else to share with them in the Government, or to join with them in Marriage. But one <hi>Labda,</hi> slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by her own Family because she was lame, married <hi>Eetion</hi> Son to <hi>Echecrates,</hi> who consulted the Delphick Oracle concerning his Issue, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd this Response, That he should have a Son, who would fall like a Stone upon the Oligarchy, and crush it to pieces. The <hi>Bacchiadae</hi> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of the Prophecy, resolv'd to make away with the Infant as soon as it was born; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly sent 10 of their Family to put the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign in Execution, under the pretence of congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulating <hi>Eetion.</hi>

                     <p n="8">8. But when they took the Child in their Arms, it smil'd so prettily upon them all, that they were mov'd with Compassion, and went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way without hurting it: But being gone, they chid one another, and return'd to put the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9. When <hi>Cypselus</hi> came of Age, he blinded the People with his Bounty, and invaded the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the 2d Year of the 31st Olympiad, in the Reign of <hi>Phraortes</hi> in <hi>Media,</hi> and <hi>Ardyes</hi> the Grandson of <hi>Croesus</hi> in <hi>Lydia,</hi> 20 Years after the <hi>Messenian</hi> War, and 30 Years after the Institution of the <hi>Archontes</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> A.

At first he establish'd himself in the Government with the Slaughter of a great many, but afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd himself so civilly and bountifully, that he made use of no Guards. His Example upon this score is truly wonderful; and <hi>Gelon,</hi> Tyrant of <hi>Syracuse,</hi> was the only King that propos'd it as a Pattern.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. After 30 Years <hi>Cypselus</hi> died, and his Son <hi>Periander</hi> succeeded, who was so timorous, that he kept a Guard of 300 Men, and chose rather to be fear'd than belov'd. Authors tell us, that at first he demean'd himself pretty moderately, and gradually degenerated into a cruel and barbarous Temper. He marry'd <hi>Melissa</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="2 letters">

                     <p n="11">11. <hi>Lycophron</hi> was mightily troubled at his Mother's Death, and prov'd so disobedient to his Father, that he banish'd him to <hi>Corcyra.</hi> But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter some Years, <hi>Periander</hi> being worn out with Age, and <hi>Cypselus</hi> being naturally unfit for Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, he call'd him home again, and purchas'd
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:136207:76"/> his Return at no less rate, than that of devesting himself of the Power, and shifting Places of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence with him. But after all, when every thing was agreed upon, the <hi>Corcyreans</hi> being resolv'd to undergo any Difficulties, rather than admit <hi>Periander,</hi> made away with the young Prince.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. <hi>Periander</hi> took the Murder of his Son so much to heart; and withal, his not being able to revenge it upon the <hi>Corcyreans;</hi> that he sunk un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it in the 80th Year of his Age, and the 40th of his Reign. He was reckon'd by some one of the Seven Wise Men. He was a most cruel Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, famous for his Knowledge of Military Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, as having pass'd all his Days in Arms, and redoubted for his Power at Sea, being furnish'd with the most commodious Harbours both in the <hi>Ionian</hi> and <hi>Egean</hi> Sea. He died in the 4th Year of the 48th Olympiad, 7 Years after <hi>Solon</hi>'s Laws were receiv'd in <hi>Athens,</hi> A. M. 3420.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. The Tyranny did not last much longer than <hi>Periander:</hi> for <hi>Psammeticus,</hi> Son to <hi>Gordias</hi> his Brother, or else to <hi>Periander</hi> his Kinsman, possess'd it only for 3 Years and 6 Months: After which time the Monarchy was abrogated, and a Popular Government erected, which continu'd as long as the Liberty of <hi>Greece</hi> it self. We are at a loss to tell what was the particular Form of this Republick; but 'tis plain from <hi>Plutarch,</hi> that the Power of the Commons was not so extensive as in that of <hi>Syracuse.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="14">14. However the Government was all over popular; for nothing of any Importance was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd without the Consent of the People. The <hi>Corinthians</hi> were mortal Enemies to Monarchy, and cou'd least brook it; upon which account
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:136207:77"/> they frequently Embarqu'd in heavy Wars, and a <hi>Corinthian</hi> General was always look'd upon as a most fit Person for extirpating Tyranny.</p>

                     <p n="2">2.

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:136207:77"/> added a Castle to it, which from him was call'd <hi>Cadmaea.</hi> He Marry'd <hi>Harmonia</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus.</hi> He was the first that intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd Letters from <hi>Phoenicia</hi> to <hi>Greece,</hi> which were thence call'd <hi>Phoenician,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasgian,</hi> because the <hi>Pelasgi</hi> were first acquainted with them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. By <hi>Harmonia Cadmus</hi> had one Son, namely, <hi>Polydorus,</hi> and four Daughters, namely, <hi>Semele, Ino, Autonoe,</hi> and <hi>Agaue.

Having establish'd himself in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he begat his Son <hi>Illyrius,</hi> who either gave the name to the People, or else deriv'd it from them.

                     <p n="4">4. This is the <hi>Grecian</hi> account of <hi>Cadmus</hi>-Tho' they Honor'd him with the Title of a King's Son, yet the <hi>Sidonans</hi> his Countrymen deny that he had any such Title, and say he was only the King's Cook, who run away with one <hi>Harmonia</hi> a Musician.

                     <p n="5">5. To which we may add, that his Wife might be call'd <hi>Harmonia</hi> from Mount <hi>Hermon;</hi> and the Fable of their being turn'd into Snakes might take its rise from <hi>Hevaeus,</hi> which in Syriack signifies a <hi>Snake.</hi> There are many Proofs that he intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd Letters into <hi>Greece.</hi> It is probable he likewise first Instituted the Rites of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and upon that account is represented as his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, whereas <hi>Nimrod</hi> was the true <hi>Bacchus.</hi> He call'd the City <hi>Thebes,</hi> there being another City in <hi>Canaan</hi> of the same name mention'd in the Book of <hi>Judges,</hi> which <hi>Josephus</hi> calls <hi>Thebae</hi> in the Plural Number.

For <hi>Apollo</hi> was order'd to put to Death all the Males, and <hi>Diana</hi> was enjoin'd to do the same to the other Sex; whereupon <hi>Niobe</hi> was so stupify'd with sorrow, that she was fabulously represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as being turn'd into a Stone. Afterwards <hi>Amphion</hi> and all his Family died of the Plague. <hi>Zethus</hi> was so griev'd for his Sons being casual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kill'd by his own Wife, that he died of a Consumption. The two Brethren being thus cut off, the <hi>Thebans</hi> restor'd the Kingdom to <hi>Laius</hi> the Son of <hi>Labdacus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>Laius</hi> marry'd <hi>Jocasta</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noeceus</hi> by whom he had a Son, whom he bound in Fetters and laid out, because the Oracle had adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd him to beware of him. The Infant, whose Feet were mightily swell'd, from whence he was call'd <hi>Oepidus,</hi> was carried to <hi>Polybus</hi> King of <hi>Corinth,</hi> who cur'd him and brought him up. Long after that, both having heard some uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rumours, the one of his Father and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Son, they went both to Consult the Oracle; and meeting accidentally in <hi>Phocis, Laius</hi> Imperiously Commanded the other to get out of his way, whereupon the Son thinking nothing of his Father kill'd him.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. After the Death of <hi>Laius, Crion</hi> the Brother of <hi>Jocasta,</hi> possess'd himself of the Kingdom, and continu'd Possessor till <hi>Oedipus</hi> unfolded the Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of <hi>Sphinx.</hi> The Story is, That this Monster
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:136207:79"/> had a Woman's Head and Face, with lower Parts resembling those of a Lion, and Wings besides: It us'd to sit on Mount <hi>Phiceon,</hi> and propose Riddles to Strangers, which whoever could not unfold was slain, and whoever could do it was to have <hi>Jocasta</hi> and her Kingdom for a reward.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The Riddle propos'd to <hi>Oedipus</hi> was this: What is it that walks upon <hi>two, three and four Feet? Oedipus</hi> apply'd it to a Man, who in his Infancy creeps upon the Ground upon his Hands and Feet, and when he comes to be of Age walks upright upon his Legs, but when Age has worn him out, he stoops and leans upon a Stick. Some say this Monster was a cruel and ugly Woman, that liv'd upon Plunder and laid wait for Strangers.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. But <hi>Pausanias</hi> says, she was a Bastard Daughter of <hi>Laius,</hi> and upon that account some think, that, by reason of her extraordinary Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, she was empower'd to determine the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates of those who were Rivals for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and punish those with Death whom she Convicted of falsities. From whence the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets took occasion to invent the Fable. The <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> had such an Opinion of this Woman's Wisdom, that they made use of the Monster, as a Hierolgyphick for Wisdom and Fortitude.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. 'Tis reported that <hi>Oedipus</hi> married his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and obtain'd the Kingdom of <hi>Thebes.</hi> But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards both his parricide and incest were brought to light. Whereupon <hi>Jocasta</hi> hang'd herself, and <hi>Oedipus</hi> was put in Prison by his Sons, and banish'd to <hi>Athens</hi> to the Court of <hi>Theseus</hi> then King, where he died. He had 2 Sons, either by his Mother or by <hi>Euryganea,</hi> namely, <hi>Eteocles</hi> and

                        <hi>Polynices,</hi> the eldest of whom promis'd to share the Government with his Brother, but was not so good as his Word. <hi>Adrostus</hi> King of <hi>Argos,</hi> and Father-in-Law to <hi>Polynices,</hi> resolv'd to resent the injury he did to his Brother, and accordingly drew together a company of the most War-like Youths, in order to attack <hi>Thebes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="13">13.

But the <hi>Thebans</hi> lost so many Men and purchas'd this Victory so dear, that <hi>Victoria Cadmaea</hi> became a Proverb among them.

                     </p>
                     <p n="14">14. <hi>Eteocles</hi> left a Young Son, nam'd <hi>Lato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus,</hi> and <hi>Creon, Jocasta</hi>'s Brother, undertook his Guardianship. <hi>Creon</hi> prohibited the Burial of the <hi>Argives,</hi> till <hi>Theseus</hi> obtain'd it by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty. About 10 Years after the War, <hi>Laoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> came of Age; at which time the Offspring of those who were kill'd (who were call'd <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goni</hi>) resolving to be reveng'd upon the <hi>Thebans,</hi> engag'd in another War, in which <hi>Laodamus</hi> and the City were taken.

                     </head>
                     <p n="1">1. THE City of <hi>Rome</hi> is situated in <hi>Latium</hi> in the West of <hi>Italy,</hi> upon the River <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi> The <hi>Sicilians</hi> are said to have inhabited that Place first, and were expell'd by the <hi>Aborigines,</hi> the Offspring of the <hi>Oenotrii,</hi> so call'd because they came from <hi>Lycaonia</hi> (afterwards <hi>Arcadia</hi>) under the Conduct of <hi>Oenotrus</hi> Son to <hi>Lycaon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. The <hi>Aborigines</hi> were joyn'd by some <hi>Pelas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians</hi> who fled from <hi>Haemonia,</hi> afterwards <hi>Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> and the <hi>Arcadians</hi> who came from <hi>Palanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Evander</hi> the Son of <hi>Mercurius</hi> and the Nymph <hi>Themis,</hi> and christen'd the Hill where they planted themselves by the name of <hi>Palantium.</hi> Not long after that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, <hi>Hercules</hi> upon his return from <hi>Spain</hi> left some <hi>Peloponnesians</hi> upon the Hill <hi>Saturnius</hi> or <hi>Capitolinus;</hi> in the reign of <hi>Faunus</hi> King of the <hi>Aborigines.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Father of <hi>Faunus</hi> was <hi>Picus</hi> the Son of <hi>Saturn,</hi> who fled from <hi>Creet</hi> to <hi>Italy</hi> for fear of his Son <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and christen'd the Country <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium, (a latendo)</hi> from his living <hi>Incognito.</hi> Some allege this Man's name was <hi>Sterces,</hi> and <hi>Picus</hi> was his Sirname; and that he gave being to the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:136207:81"/>
                        <hi>Laurentian</hi> Kingdom so call'd from <hi>Laurentum</hi> a City that deriv'd its name from the <hi>Laurel-tree.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. This <hi>Faunus</hi> or <hi>Fatuus</hi> is said to have mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his Sister <hi>Fauna</hi> or <hi>Fatua,</hi> who us'd to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie things to come in a Fit of Madness or Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; from whence the Word <hi>Fatuari</hi> was applied to that sort of People. But since he is reckon'd the Sons of <hi>Mars,</hi> and is said to have serv'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Bacchus</hi> in <hi>India;</hi> since he goes likewise by the name of <hi>Sylvanus, Invius</hi> and <hi>Pan;</hi> he must be the same <hi>Pan Arcas,</hi> whose Worship was introduc'd into <hi>Italy</hi> by <hi>Evander.</hi> So far was he from reigning in <hi>Latium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Next King to <hi>Faunus</hi> was <hi>Latinus,</hi> whom some give in for his Son, and others for the Son of <hi>Hercules.</hi> In the 35th Year of the Reign of <hi>Latinus,</hi> and 55 Years after <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi>'s departure, <hi>Aeneas</hi> with his <hi>Trojan</hi> retinue landed at <hi>Laurentum</hi> near the Mouth of the <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beris,</hi> after he had wander'd a long time. This <hi>Aeneas</hi> was the Son of <hi>Anchises,</hi> the Grandson of <hi>Capys,</hi> and Great Grandson to <hi>Assaracus,</hi> Brother to <hi>Ilus,</hi> and Son to <hi>Tros</hi> the King. When he perceiv'd that <hi>Troy</hi> was reduc'd to the last extremity, he had retir'd to the <hi>Castle;</hi> and while the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were busi'd about the Town, escap'd from thence to Mount <hi>Ida</hi> with a Company of Men.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. From thence he put out to Sea, and was toss'd up and down by the Sea and Winds for a long time, till at last in the 2d Year he arriv'd in <hi>Italy</hi> accompany'd by 600 Men. 'Tis true, <hi>Virgil,</hi> the Poet, makes as if he came not to <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> till the 10th Year, and stuffs the accounts of his Voyage with a long Story of <hi>Dido,</hi> who built
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:136207:81"/>
                        <hi>Carthage</hi> 310 Years after the taking of <hi>Troy;</hi> but these are only Poetical Fictions, and groundless advances.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Aeneas</hi> having a piece of Ground allotted him, assisted <hi>Latinus</hi> against the <hi>Rutili;</hi> and when they were conquer'd married his Daughter <hi>Lavinia,</hi> from whom the Town he afterwards built was call'd <hi>Lavinium.</hi> Next Year the <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tili</hi> rebell'd, and kill'd his Father-in-Law in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, so that he got the Crown, and gave all his Subjects the Name of <hi>Latini,</hi> partly for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Father's Name, and partly in order to unite the Minds of his People. In the 7th Year after the destruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> and the 4th after the Death of <hi>Latinus, Mezentius</hi> King of the <hi>Etrurians,</hi> being apprehensive of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, declar'd War against him; and came to a battel, which only Night decided, in which <hi>Aeneas</hi> disappear'd; that is, was either kill'd or drown'd in the River <hi>Numicus.</hi> However his Subjects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd he was taken up to Heaven, and honour'd him with a Niche, under the Title of <hi>Jupiter In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digetes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>Aeneas</hi> was follow'd by his Son <hi>Ascanius,</hi> whose name was <hi>Euryleon</hi> before it was chang'd upon the Flight. 'Tis not certain whether he was born of <hi>Creusa</hi> or <hi>Lavinia.</hi> About 30 Years after the building of <hi>Lavinium</hi> he left that City to his Stepmother, and march'd off with a Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and built <hi>Alba Longa.</hi> After 28 Years <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> the Brother of <hi>Ascanius</hi> succeeded him. He was the Son of <hi>Lavinia</hi> who for fear of <hi>Ascanius</hi> retir'd to the Woods, and there brought forth this her posthumous Child.</p>
                     <p n="9">
                        <pb n="140" facs="tcp:136207:82"/>9. <hi>Iulus</hi> the Son of <hi>Ascanius</hi> disputed with him for the Kingdom; but the People thought fit to give the Priesthood to him and his Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. After <hi>Sylvius</hi> all his Successors were Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam'd <hi>Sylvius</hi>'s; and they follow'd in this order; <hi>viz. Aeneas Sylvius, Latinus, Alba, Capetus, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pys, Calpetus</hi> or <hi>Carpentus, Tiberinus</hi> (who was drown'd in the <hi>Albula</hi> and gave it the name of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beris) Agrippa, Alladius</hi> (or <hi>Aremulus</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus) Aventinas, Procas</hi> and <hi>Sylvius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>Procas</hi> was the 13th King of <hi>Alba.</hi> He left two Sons, namely, <hi>Numitor</hi> and <hi>Amulius,</hi> the latter of whom dethron'd his Elder Brother and usurp'd the Government. He kill'd his Son, and for fear his Daughter <hi>Sylvia</hi> or <hi>Ilia</hi> should have Issue, Consecrated her for a Priestess to <hi>Vesta.</hi> But in the 4th Year of her Priesthood, some body got her with Child, and she brought forth Twins, namely, <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Remus;</hi> who were thrown into the River by the King's Orders, their Mother being either Murder'd or Condemn'd to perpetual Emprisonment.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. But it happen'd that the Water Ebb'd and left them on the dry Ground, whereupon a Wolf came and Suckled them, and afterwards <hi>Faustu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> the King's Shepherd found them, and brought them up among the Royal Shepherds. Some think that <hi>Acca Laurentia</hi> who Nurs'd them by the orders of <hi>Faustulus,</hi> was not his Wife, but his Whore, which gave occasion to the fabulous Story of their being suckled by a <hi>Wolf</hi> or <hi>Lupa;</hi> that being the Name for a Whore, as <hi>Lupana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> was for a Bawdy-house.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. When the Children came of Age, and were acquainted with their Original, they slew <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi>
                        <pb n="141" facs="tcp:136207:82"/> and restor'd their Grandfather <hi>Numitor</hi> to his Kingdom. Having set the Affairs of <hi>Alba</hi> in a peaceable State, they had a mind to March out with a Colony. <hi>Numitor</hi> encourag'd their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, and to that end allotted 'em the Grounds upon which they were brought up, together with such Citizens as he knew to be most devoted to his Brother, and such as preferr'd a strange Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation to their own Country. Most of the <hi>Trojans</hi> Listed themselves in the Colony, and we're inform'd that 50 <hi>Trojan</hi> Families conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued till the time of <hi>Dionysius Halicarnasseus.</hi> The Inhabitants of <hi>Palantium</hi> and <hi>Saturnia,</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening to live upon the Place, join'd in with them.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. When the Brethren set about their new Project, they differ'd upon the place where the City should be Built. <hi>Romulus</hi> was for the <hi>Mons Palatinus,</hi> upon which they were brought up. At last the Affair was left to the determination of their Grandfather; who advis'd them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to the augury of Birds. Accordingly it was done. And <hi>Remus</hi> had first six Vultures up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Mons Aventinus;</hi> but afterwards twelve came to <hi>Romulus</hi> upon the <hi>Palatinus.</hi> Whereupon the Discord was still inflam'd, while the one pleaded the Priority of Time, and the other the advantage of Number, and both were declar'd Kings by their followers. At last they came to an Engagement, in which <hi>Rèmus</hi> lost at once both his Life and Kingdom. Then <hi>Romulus</hi> having an uncontroll'd Liberty to do what he pleas'd, surrounded the <hi>Aventian</hi> Hill with a Wall.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. This is the most Probable and approv'd Account of the Original of <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
                        <pb n="142" facs="tcp:136207:83"/> attribute the building of it, some to <hi>Romus</hi> the Son of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> some to <hi>Aeneas</hi> himself, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the Sons of <hi>Latinus</hi> and one <hi>Roma,</hi> and others again to <hi>Remus</hi> the Son of <hi>Circe</hi> and <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lysses.</hi> Neither are the <hi>Roman</hi> Writers agreed upon the matter; for some give in the Sons of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and others his Daughter's Sons, for the Builders. Besides <hi>Antiochus</hi> the <hi>Syracusan</hi> makes mention of a City of <hi>Rome</hi> built before the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan</hi> War; so that some think it was built oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than once, or else that some time after its building it was repair'd by others.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. But to wave the Debate, whether this was a new <hi>Albanian</hi> Colony, or an Old City re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built; Authors are very much divided upon the time of the rebuilding. <hi>Timaeus Siculus</hi> makes the Date of <hi>Rome</hi> equal to that of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and says it was built 38 Years before the first Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad. And among those who are look'd upon as most Authentick, some say it was built in the 6 Olympiad, <hi>viz.</hi> The first Year of it, according to <hi>Velleius Paterculus,</hi> or the third according to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or the fourth according to <hi>Varro</hi> the most Learn'd of all the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> who in that point follow'd <hi>Tarrutius</hi> the famous Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematician.</p>
                     <p n="16">16.

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>ROmulus</hi> being 28 Years of Age, laid the Foundation of the City, on the 20th day of <hi>April</hi> (according to the <hi>Julian</hi> Year, the 4th of <hi>October</hi>) between Eleven and Twelve a Clock, when the <hi>Sun</hi> was in <hi>Libra,</hi> the <hi>Moon</hi> in <hi>Jugum, Jupiter</hi> in <hi>Piscis; Saturn, Venus, Mars,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> in <hi>Scorpio,</hi> according to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of <hi>Tarrutius,</hi> who is certainly the most topping Man among all the Mathematicians. <hi>Varro, Ovid,</hi> and others wou'd have <hi>Rome</hi> to be Founded with the <hi>Parilia</hi> or <hi>Palilia.</hi> The <hi>Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> were so call'd a <hi>Pariendo,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Hyades,</hi> under which the Town was Built, go by the Name of <hi>Parilitium,</hi> or <hi>Palilitium Sydus.</hi> Now <hi>Pales</hi> among the <hi>Romans</hi> was the <hi>Goddess</hi> of Pasture, and the Feasts Celebrated to her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour on the 1 Day of <hi>May</hi> were call'd <hi>Palilia. Capellus,</hi> pursuant to <hi>Tarrutius</hi>'s Opinion, dates the 1 Year of the City from the first <hi>New Moon</hi> of <hi>January</hi> and <hi>Capricorn,</hi> 3 Months after its Foundation was laid.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The Colony consisted only of 300 Horse and 3000 Foot, and in order to enlarge their Number, a Sanctuary was open'd to all Refugees. The People were divided according to their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber into three Tribes, and every Tribe into ten Wards, or <hi>Curiae,</hi> and every Ward into ten les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:136207:84"/> Wards or <hi>Decuriae.</hi> But with reference to their Dignities, they were distinguish'd into <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricii</hi> and <hi>Plebeii,</hi> who were mutually engag'd to one another by the rights of Patronage and Vassalage. Their Senate, was elected by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and consisted of 100 <hi>Patricii.</hi> It got its Name from <hi>Senium,</hi> or, if we Credit <hi>Festus, a Sinendo.</hi> The People did likewise chuse 300 Young Men for a Guard to their King, who were call'd <hi>Celeres,</hi> either from their <hi>Celerity</hi> and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition in executing their Orders, or, according to <hi>Valerius Antias,</hi> from <hi>Celer</hi> their Captain.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The Politick Constitution of the Kingdom of <hi>Rome</hi> was this. The Kings had Power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine all forms of Worship or Superstition; and to oversee all Laws and Customs, whether Natural, or Enacted by Statute; and to give Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in matters of greater Importance, those of lesser Moment being left to the determination of the Senate. Moreover, the King had Power to call the Senate, to call together the People, to give his Opinion first, and to ratifie what the Majority carry'd. Thus we see the limits of the King's power were too confin'd at Home; but his Power in Military Affairs was not at all bounded.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The Senat's Priviledge was to take into Consideration his Majesties Proposals, and Enact what they thought fit. The People assembled was to create Magistrates, make Laws, receive his Majesties Proposals of Military Affairs, but not without the intervention of the Senate's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. For when the Wards Voted any thing, their Decree or <hi>Plebiscitum</hi> was remitted to the Senate. Tho' this Custom seems to be afterwards
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:136207:84"/> chang'd, when the People confirm'd the Acts of the Senate call'd <hi>Senatus Consulta,</hi> and not the Senate those of the Wards.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Romulus</hi> made many Laws and those very good ones, most of which were written. He enacted, that if they took any Land from their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, a Colony should be carried thither, and the Inhabitants of the Place should be translated to <hi>Rome,</hi> and allow'd the Freedom of the City. His Laws of Matrimony were so admirably well contriv'd, that for 520 Years no Divorce was heard of, till the 137 Olympiad, in which <hi>Sp. Carvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> divorc'd his Wife, in the Consulship of <hi>M. Pomponius</hi> and <hi>C. Papyrius.</hi> For tho' he did it for the sake of Children, according to his Oath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Censors, yet the People always hated him for it.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Indeed he gave Parents too much Power over their Children. He prohibited sordid Trades and such as promoted Luxury. He only desir'd to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Arts of War and Husbandry, and allow'd Mercats only once in 9 Days. He us'd to come in Person to the Mercat Place, and pronounce the Laws from a <hi>Tribunal,</hi> attended by the 300 <hi>Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi> together with Sergeants before him carrying the Axes and Rods, and other Badges of Majesty.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Romulus</hi> taking into consideration how much he was hated by the neighbouring Nations, courted Alliances with them. It is uncertain whether it was the Scarcity of Women, or the design of an opportunity of War, that mov'd him to institute solemn Games, and when great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of People crouded to see them from all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to give the Signal to his own Men to ravish their Virgins. However 683 were ravish'd by that
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:136207:85"/> Stratagem, which gave rise to a heavy War, especially with the <hi>Sabini,</hi> who became Masters of the Capitol by Treachery, and gall'd the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> mightily.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. While both Parties were sollicitous concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the event, the Women upon whose account the War broke out, went upon an embassy, and reconcil'd their Parents and Husbands upon these Terms. 1. That <hi>Tatius</hi> the King of the <hi>Sabines</hi> should reign along with <hi>Romulus</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> with equal Power. 2. That the City it self should be call'd <hi>Rome</hi> from <hi>Romulus;</hi> but the Citizens should go by the name of <hi>Quirites</hi> from <hi>Cures</hi> which was <hi>Tatius</hi>'s Country. 3. Any of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines</hi> that pleas'd were to have the Freedom of the City.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. By this means <hi>Tatius</hi> bacame Sharer in the Government of the Kingdom of <hi>Rome,</hi> but was kill'd by the <hi>Lavinians</hi> about 5 Years after, because he refus'd to deliver up some Robbers. <hi>Romulus</hi> did not much resent the murder of his Colleague, but gave Satisfaction to the plaintiffs. Then he conquer d the <hi>Fidenates</hi> and <hi>Crustumeni,</hi> and at last the <hi>Veientes;</hi> by which conquests, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his other enterprises which were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways successful, he became a <hi>Tyrant,</hi> and then the Senate was never call'd but to confirm his <hi>Placita.</hi> By which means he render'd himself so odious to the Senate, that they pull'd him in Pieces at the Lake of <hi>Capria</hi> while he harangu'd to the People; and for so much as he disappear'd all of a sudden, it was giv'n out that he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up to Heaven.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. He liv'd 55 Years, and reign'd 27, and enlarg'd the number of the Citizens to the rate
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:136207:85"/> of 46000 foot and 1000 Horse. He had suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to his Grandfather in the Kingdom of <hi>Albany</hi> which he govern'd by Deputies. He died on the 5th Day <hi>July</hi> (acccording to the <hi>Julian</hi> Year, on the 26th of <hi>May</hi>) which day was call'd <hi>Nonae Caprotinae,</hi> alluding to the Place where the Murder was committed, and the flight of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for the <hi>Plebs</hi> was in so great a Consterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they run all away.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. The Senate govern'd the Republick one Year, after which <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> a <hi>Sabine</hi> was chosen King. This Prince added the Ornament of Laws to the City that ow'd its rise to Arms alone. He built a Temple to <hi>Janus,</hi> which was always to stand open in War, and shut in time of Peace. He discarded <hi>Romulus</hi>'s Guards; and to the 2 <hi>Flamines, viz.</hi> one for <hi>Jupiter</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for <hi>Mars,</hi> he added a 3d for <hi>Romulus.</hi> He instituted the order of Priests, and vestal Virgins; and reform'd the Model of the Year, by adding or at least prefixing <hi>January</hi> and <hi>February</hi> to the other 10 Months.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. His Religion came nearest to the <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean</hi> Worship, as in many other things so especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in this that he allow'd no image of God; for an immortal and invisible Majesty is only to be view'd by the Soul, and indeed the <hi>Romans</hi> us'd no image of him for 170 Years. Whereas some have alledg'd that <hi>Numa</hi> convers'd with <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras;</hi> that Plea is plainly naught, since that Philospher was not born till 100 Years after his Death. Indeed 'tis true he kept company with one <hi>Pythagoras</hi> a <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> who assisted him in the administration of the Government, and who went into <hi>Italy</hi> in the 16th Olympiad, from the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:136207:86"/> 3d Year of which <hi>Plutarch</hi> dates the beginnig of <hi>Numa's</hi> Reign.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. After <hi>Numa</hi> had reign'd 43 Years, and liv'd 80, <hi>Tullius Hostilius</hi> succeeded him, in the 2d Year of the 27th Olympiad, in which <hi>Eury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates</hi> won the Race, in the Archonship of <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratus,</hi> the 31 of the Reign of <hi>Manasseh</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> and the 83 from the building of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, A. M. 3333. He was the Son of that <hi>Hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> who behav'd himself so bravely against the <hi>Sabines,</hi> and married <hi>Hersilia</hi> out of the same Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. He ingratiated himself with the People by the division of Lands, and added the Hill <hi>Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> to the precincts of the City. He was a Warlike Prince and hugg'd all Opportunities of War.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. <hi>Hostilius</hi> took occasion to declare War, upon the <hi>Alban's</hi> plundering the <hi>Roman</hi> Grounds. And indeed <hi>C. Cluilius</hi> their Dictator was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to Peace. But as soon as <hi>Cluilius</hi> dy'd, the <hi>Albans</hi> were much dishearten'd notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pains that <hi>Metius Suffetius</hi> his Successor took to inflame the Quarrel. Besides, the <hi>Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates</hi> waited greedily to see the Event of the War, as having an equal design against both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Whereupon 'twas mov'd and agreed to, that the matter should be decided by the Engagement of Three Brethren on each side, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Hora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tii</hi> and <hi>Curiatii.</hi> In the beginning of the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment two of the <hi>Horatii</hi> were kill'd, and the third was oblig'd to engage the other three; but acted his part so, that he engag'd 'em all singly and successively, by which means he got the Victory, and <hi>Rome</hi> triumph'd upon it.</p>
                     <p n="15">
                        <pb n="149" facs="tcp:136207:86"/>15. <hi>Hostilius</hi> was very civil to the <hi>Albans.</hi> But sentenc'd <hi>Suffetius</hi> to be beheaded, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concern'd with the <hi>Fidenates</hi> and <hi>Veientes</hi> in a perfidious Conspiracy. He likewise levell'd <hi>Alba</hi> with the Ground, which was then the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan of <hi>Rome,</hi> and about 30 other Towns, after it had stood about 487 Years.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. <hi>Hostilius</hi> first conquer'd the <hi>Fidenatians,</hi> and afterwards the <hi>Sabines:</hi> And then declar'd War against the <hi>Latines,</hi> for refusing to pay Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to the <hi>Romans</hi> when they conquer'd the Metropolitan. The War went on pretty easily for 5 Years, and then they were beginning to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain some Thoughts of Peace, when all of a sudden <hi>Tullus</hi> and all his Family were cut off either by a Thunderbolt, or, as most Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, by the intrigues of his Successor, after he had reign'd 32 Years.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. After the Death of <hi>Tullus</hi> the Regent put up an election; and <hi>Ancus Martius, Numa</hi>'s Grandson, was pitch'd upon to be King in the 2d Year of the 35th Olympiad, in which <hi>Phaedrus</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> won the Race, in the <hi>Archonship</hi> of <hi>Damasias,</hi> and the 115 Year from the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Rome. Ancus</hi> devoted himself entirely to Peace and Religion; and was thereupon accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Lazy and Timorous. But the <hi>Latines</hi> quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rous'd him up, by plundering the Country, and reviving the War.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. But <hi>Ancus</hi> quickly reduc'd them, as well as the <hi>Fidenates, Volsci, Vejentes,</hi> and <hi>Sabines.</hi> He joyn'd <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Janiculum</hi> by a Bridge. And in the middle of the City built a Prison for Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals. He enlarg'd the precincts of the City, and extended the Dominions of <hi>Rome</hi> to the Sea, and for
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:136207:87"/> the encouragement of Trade built <hi>Ostia</hi> in the Mouth of the <hi>Tiberis.</hi> He reign'd 24 Years, and was short of none of his Predecessors.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. His Succcessor was <hi>Lucius Tarquinius,</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally a Grecian, being the Son of <hi>Demaratus</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> who descended of the <hi>Bacchiadae,</hi> and in the time of <hi>Cypselus</hi>'s Tyranny came to <hi>Hetru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> and begot two Sons, namely <hi>Aruns</hi> and <hi>Lucumo,</hi> upon an <hi>Etrurian</hi> Matron. <hi>Aruns</hi> died without any living issue; but after his Death a Posthumous Child was brought forth, which from its Poverty was christen'd <hi>Egerius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="20">20. For <hi>Demaratus</hi> took his Son's Death so much to Heart, that he died for Grief: So that <hi>Lucumo</hi> possess'd himself of the whole Heritage and became very rich; but not meeting with sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table preferment in <hi>Tuscany</hi> came to <hi>Rome;</hi> where <hi>Ancus</hi> gave him a very civil reception, and he chang'd his name from <hi>Lucumo</hi> to <hi>Lucius,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a Sirname taken from his Country <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinia.</hi> His Wife's name was <hi>Tanaquil Gaja Caecilia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="21">21. <hi>Ancus</hi> made <hi>Tarquinius</hi> a Senator; so that <hi>Tarquinius</hi> won a considerable share of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the People. He was noted both for his peaceful and military Vertues; and the King depended so much upon his Integrity, that he left him Guardian to his Sons. But <hi>Tarquinius</hi> insulted over their Childhood, and harangued the People, in order to hook in the Kingdom to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. He produc'd the Example of <hi>Tatius</hi> and <hi>Numa</hi> to vouch for a Foreigners Title to that Dignity; but above all, cry'd up his own Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality. By which means he compass'd his end, in the 2d Year of the 41st Olympiad, in which <hi>Cleonidas</hi> the <hi>Theban</hi> won the Race, 139 Years
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:136207:87"/> after the building of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the 30th Year of <hi>Josiah</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> A. M. 3390.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. <hi>Tarquinius</hi> oblig'd the <hi>Latines</hi> to beg for Peace. He subdued the <hi>Sabines</hi> twice, and after a War of Nine Years standing, master'd the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trurians,</hi> who in testimony of their Homage sent him of their own accord the Badges of Majesty, <hi>viz.</hi> A Crown of Gold, a Throne of Ivory, a Scepter with an Eagle on the top of it, a Purple Coat barr'd with Gold, and a Purple lac'd Gown that differ'd from those which the <hi>Lydian</hi> and <hi>Persian</hi> Kings wore, by its semicircular Figure. Some say they likewise sent 12 Axes for so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Towns: For the Custom was, That the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate of every Town should have one, and the General of the Army twelve, carried before him.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. I intimated above, that <hi>Romulus</hi> instituted a Senat of 100 Men; which number was now enlarg'd by the Addition of an equal number of <hi>Sabines,</hi> who were made free of the City, and thereupon call'd <hi>Patres Conscripti. Tarquinius</hi> added, to these 200, yet another hundred, who were styl'd <hi>Patres Minorum Gentium.</hi> He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larg'd the number of the Vestal Virgins from 4 to 7. He beautified the <hi>Forum,</hi> and repair'd the Walls (which had been built in a hurry) with Stones, every one of which was a full Cart-load by itself. He likewise caus'd Sinks and Common-Shoars to be made for conveying the filth of the <hi>Tiberis;</hi> which was so magnificent an underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that the Censors laid out 2000 Talents in cleaning 'em.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. He design'd to add three Centuries of Hors-men to the like number instituted by <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus:</hi> But being premonish'd by <hi>Actius Naevius,</hi> a
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:136207:88"/> noted <hi>Augur,</hi> to avoid the Alterations of <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>'s Model, he doubled the Number of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Centuries, and left the other three as they were. At length about the 38 Year of his Reign, and the 80 of his Age, he was kill'd by a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy of <hi>Ancus Martius</hi> his Sons. He was Sirnam'd <hi>Priscus,</hi> from the time that his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son was christen'd <hi>Superbus</hi> from the Corruption of his manners.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. <hi>Tarquinius Priscus</hi> was follow'd by <hi>Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Tullius</hi> in the 4th Year of the 50 Olympiad, in the Archonship of <hi>Archestratides,</hi> the 176 Year after the building of the City, A.M. 3427. He was call'd <hi>Servius,</hi> as being the Son of one <hi>Ocrisia Serva,</hi> who was left with Child when her Husband was kill'd before <hi>Corniculum</hi> a City belonging to the <hi>Latines,</hi> and was gifted by <hi>Tarquinius</hi> to the Queen. He was born and brought up in <hi>Tarqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>'s House, and gave great Proof of an excellent Genius: Whereupon he was prefer'd to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Posts both in the Army and at home; he was equally lov'd by the People for his integrity and prudence; and at last came to be Son-in-Law to <hi>Tarquinius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="26">26. <hi>Tarquinius</hi> left no Sons alive, only two Grandchildren very Young. The Queen wheed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the People so that she got the Guardianship of these two Children to him. He being Regent did so Humor the <hi>Plebs,</hi> that in spite of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat</hi> and the <hi>Patres Conscripti,</hi> the Common Council or <hi>Comìtia Curiata</hi> elected him King. Having confirm'd himself in the Government, he distributed Publick Lands to the Poor; he made 50 Laws in the Common Council concerning Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts and Injuries; he added the <hi>Viminalis</hi> and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:136207:88"/>
                        <hi>Esquilinus</hi> Hills to the other 5, and surrounded 'em all with a Wall; he divided the City into 4 Parts, and added a 4th Tribe.</p>
                     <p n="27">27. Whereas <hi>Romulus</hi> divided the People into the <hi>Tribes</hi> and <hi>Wards,</hi> according to their Seats and way of Communion in their Sacrifices; <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> drew them up in 6 Ranks according to their Substance. The first rank was alloted to those who were worth 110000 <hi>Asses;</hi> the next four comprehended those whose Substance was gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally less by a fourth Part; and the last included those who had little or nothing.</p>
                     <p n="28">28. However these 6 Classes were divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to 188 Centuries; the first contain'd 80 of Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and 18 of Horsemen; in all 98: the second 22, including the Tradesmen; the third 20; the fourth 22; the 5th 30; and the 6th only one Century. Both the Men and their Estates were to be tax'd according to their Centuries. So that tho' the Richer sort were the fewer in number, yet being divided into several Centuries they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed more Money and Men towards a War.</p>
                     <p n="29">29. But after all, the Poor had nothing to boast of, for the same Law strip'd 'em of all Power. For, whereas formerly their number gave 'em an ascendant in the common Council; <hi>Servius</hi> order'd that matters of great importance should be handled by a convention of the Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. The first that voted, was the first Class con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of 98 Centuries of the richest Citizens; and if these 98 agreed upon one Vote, they were sure to carry it, as being more numerous than the rest. But if their Votes jarr'd, other Classes were call'd in till the 98 came to agree.</p>

                        <pb n="154" facs="tcp:136207:89"/>30. And if after all they did not agree, then at last the 6th Class, containing only one Century of the Poorest sort of People, was call'd to vote, but withal very seldom. In the mean time, let the young Historian remark, that the Word <hi>Centuria</hi> do's not imply just a hundred Men, but a certain division of Men; and that in those <hi>Conventions of the Centuries,</hi> 'twas not every sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Man, but every Century, let its number be what it would, that gave in one Vote.</p>
                     <p n="31">31. When <hi>Tullius</hi> had gone through with the <hi>Census,</hi> by which he came to know both the Number and the Estates of the People; he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a <hi>Lustrum</hi> so call'd <hi>a luendo,</hi> as <hi>Flustrum</hi> is <hi>a fluendo,</hi> according to <hi>Varro.</hi> So thar after the rating was over, the Citizens appear'd in Arms in the <hi>Campus Martius</hi> and made a Proces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and the Sacrifice of <hi>Suovetaurilia,</hi> or a Hog, a Sheep, and an Ox, were offer'd up.</p>
                     <p n="32">32. Then the Procession or <hi>Lustrum</hi> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be every 5th Year, for the Money was paid every 5th Year, and <hi>Lustrum</hi> seems to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive its name from paying or <hi>a luendo</hi> or <hi>Solvendo.</hi> After the Kings were expell'd, the <hi>Consuls</hi> and <hi>Censors</hi> manag'd the Ceremony. But in the mean time 'tis proper to distinguish between the Ancient <hi>Roman Lustrum,</hi> and the new <hi>Julian</hi> one, which consists of 4 <hi>Julian</hi> Years, the last of which has 366 Days without any additional Hours. For 'tis apparent that the Ancient <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strum,</hi> properly so call'd, included full 5 Years, and could by no means quadrate with the Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piads.</p>
                     <p n="33">33. In this first review, 84700 <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens were rated; and in order to increase their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:136207:89"/> he introduc'd the <hi>Manumission</hi> of the Elders and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided 'em thus set free into 4 Tribes. At first indeed they were not made free, but upon very good grounds; but afterwards any Misdemeanor in an ill Master was accounted sufficient; so that <hi>Dionysus</hi> had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to blame the City that govern'd the World, for suffering their Censors to degrade the <hi>Senators</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quites,</hi> and to have no regard to the Merit of those whom they made free of their City.</p>
                     <p n="34">34. <hi>Tullius</hi> did not only abridge the Authority of the Noblemen and the Senat, but likewise lower'd the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Power, in order to advance the Power of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The <hi>Latines,</hi> by his Advice, built a Temple to <hi>Diana</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> where they met every Year upon a a Festival, and remitted their mutual Debates to the Publick Judgment; which was the same Project that the <hi>Amphyctiones</hi> pursu'd in <hi>Greece,</hi> as well as in the <hi>Ionian</hi> Council in <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and the Convention of the <hi>Dorians</hi> at <hi>Epitropium.</hi> He was the first that stamp'd the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies of Cattel upon Mony; from whence 'twas call'd <hi>Pecunia;</hi> for before that time, the <hi>Romans</hi> only us'd the unpolish'd Mettal.</p>
                     <p n="35">35. This was <hi>Servius</hi>'s business at home. Abroad, he wag'd War with the <hi>Etrurians,</hi> and, after three Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs, at last subdu'd 'em. But tho' he surmounted all Publick Jealousies and Oppositions, yet the Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick Feuds, was too hard for him. For he married his two Daughters to <hi>Tarquinius</hi>'s two Grandsons, <hi>viz.</hi> One Daughter of corrupt Manners to the best of the Princes, and another of extraordinary good Qualities to a Profligate Prince. Whereupon the two corrupt Parties, one of either Sex, combin'd together to kill, the one her Husband, the other his Wife, and then to marry together. After that, their business was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move <hi>Servius</hi> out of the way, who had possess'd himself of the Kingdom by trick, and without the Consent of the <hi>Patres:</hi> But in order to compass that end, there was a necessity of winning the Favour of the People.</p>
                     <p n="36">36. At last when <hi>Servius</hi>'s Glory defeated all their attempts; <hi>Tarquinius,</hi> upon his Wife's Sollicitation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:136207:90"/> to make away with his Father-in-Law. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, he came to the Council-House, and pull'd the old Gentleman from off his Throne, and dragg'd him to the Door, and when he offer'd to return home set Men upon him to kill him. And the barbarous Daughter would needs have her Coach drove over her Father's Corps as they lay in the way; from whence the Street chang'd its name from <hi>Vicus Cyprius</hi> to <hi>Vicus Sceleratus.</hi> This was <hi>Servius</hi>'s <hi>Exit</hi> after he had reign'd 44 Years. He was a Man of great Moderation, and by his modest Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour wip'd off the Imputations he was charg'd with for invading the Government. The <hi>Patricii</hi> saw that he design'd to put the Power into the Hands of the People, and therefore joyn'd in with <hi>Tarquinius,</hi> in order to keep up the Authority of the Senat.</p>
                     <p n="37">37. <hi>Lucius Tarquinius</hi> possess'd himself of the Kingdom of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the 4 Year of the 61st Olympiad, in which <hi>Agatharchus</hi> won the Race, in the <hi>Archonship</hi> of <hi>Heraclius</hi> or <hi>Heraclides,</hi> the 26 Year of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> 220 Years after the building of the City, A. M. 3471. The violence of his Temper procur'd him the Sirname of <hi>Superbus;</hi> for, 'tis said, he dispos'd of every thing at discretion; he sunk the Authority of the Senate and Conventions, and fill'd the City with Blood and Rapes. He ingag'd in a War with the <hi>Volsci,</hi> which continued 20 Years; and defeated the <hi>Sabines.</hi> He enter'd into a confederacy with the <hi>Aequi</hi> and <hi>Hetrusci.</hi> He took from the <hi>Volsci,</hi> the City of <hi>Gabii</hi> together with <hi>Suessa Pometia,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to build the Capitol upon its Spoil, out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his Grandfather <hi>Tarquinius</hi>'s Vow, who, in the last War against the <hi>Sabines,</hi> had vow'd a Temple to <hi>Jupiter, Juno</hi> and <hi>Minerva;</hi> and had been at a great deal of Charges, in smoothing the Rock.</p>
                     <p n="38">38. It is said that a certain old Woman came to <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinius,</hi> and offer'd him 9 Books which he refus'd to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase as being overrated: Whereupon she went off, and burnt 3 of 'em, and return'd with the other 6, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the same price for them: the King put her off for a Mad Woman; but she made away with 3 more,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:136207:90"/> and offer'd the remaining 3 at the same rate. Then the matter was look'd upon as a Prodigy and referr'd to the <hi>Augurs,</hi> who advis'd the King to buy those <hi>Sibylline</hi> Books (for so they were call'd) at any rate. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 'twas done, and the Woman immediately disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd.</p>
                     <p n="39">39. <hi>Tarquinius</hi> having purchas'd the <hi>Sibylline</hi> Books, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd two Men to take care of 'em, and allow'd only them to consult them when there was occasion, whence they were call'd <hi>Duumviri Sacrorum.</hi> Afterwards the number was enlarg'd so that they became <hi>Decemviri Sacrorum,</hi> upon the reception of the Law call'd <hi>Septia Licinia,</hi> when the States were at variance, about 2 Years before the Commoners were allow'd to share in the Consulship. A long while after that 5 more were added, and then the number was at a stand. By an Act of the Senate these Books were to be consulted, when Sedition prevail'd in the Republick, when they were routed in War, or when prodigies appear'd. They were kept in a Stone Chest under the Capitol, till both they and the Place fell a Sacrifice to the Flames. Then they were sought for in other Towns and private Houses, and some were made use of that were spurious; but the <hi>Genuin</hi> sort were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish'd by Acrostick lines.</p>
                     <p n="40">40. This Old Woman which brought the Books to <hi>Tarquinius,</hi> was call'd <hi>Sibylla.</hi> Now that Word signifies a Woman privy to <hi>Jupiters</hi>'s Counsels; and it will not be improper to give a short account of the Family of the <hi>Sibylls.</hi> The first <hi>Sibylla,</hi> according to <hi>Varro,</hi> was either a Persian, Chaldean, or Hebrean; born at <hi>Noe</hi> near the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> her Father's name being <hi>Barossus,</hi> her Mother's <hi>Erymantha,</hi> and her own <hi>Sambetha.</hi> The second was a <hi>Lybian.</hi> The third, the Delphick <hi>Themis.</hi> The fourth a <hi>Cumean</hi> from <hi>Cimerium</hi> a Town in <hi>Campania</hi> near to <hi>Cumae</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi> The 6th was a <hi>Samian;</hi> her name was <hi>Phyto.</hi> The seventh was of <hi>Cuma;</hi> her name was <hi>Amal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaea,</hi> and according to others <hi>Hierophile</hi> or <hi>Demophile.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="41">41. <hi>Suidas</hi> calls her <hi>Hierophile,</hi> and says that she car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried those 9 Books to <hi>Tarquinius,</hi> and demanded 300 <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippus</hi>'s
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:136207:91"/> for 'em. <hi>Plinius</hi> mentions only 3 Books, and says that one of 'em was sav'd when the other 2 were burnt. The 8th <hi>Sibylla</hi> was of <hi>Hellespont.</hi> She was born in the <hi>Trojan</hi> Territories, in a Village call'd <hi>Marmissum</hi> near the Town <hi>Gergetium. Heraclides Ponticus</hi> writes that she liv'd in the time of <hi>Solon</hi> and <hi>Cyrus.</hi> The 9th was a <hi>Phrygian,</hi> and prophecy'd in <hi>Ancyra.</hi> The 10th a <hi>Tiburtine;</hi> her name was <hi>Albunea,</hi> and she was worship'd for a Goddess at <hi>Tibur</hi> near the Banks of <hi>Anio;</hi> it being said that the image of her holding a Book in her Hand was found in that Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                     <p n="42">42. This is <hi>Varro</hi>'s account of the <hi>Sybills.</hi> But there are yet others made mention of; namely <hi>Colophonia Elis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa, Cassandra</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Priamus, Sybilla Epirotica,</hi> the <hi>Thessalian Manto,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Tiresias</hi> the <hi>Theban;</hi> to whom we might add <hi>Carmentis</hi> the Arcadian, Mother to <hi>Evander,</hi> and <hi>Fauna</hi> or <hi>Fatua</hi> Sister and Wife to King <hi>Faunus. Strabo</hi> mentions 2 <hi>Sibylls</hi> that liv'd in <hi>Erythra,</hi> one of whom flourish'd in the Reign of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great.</p>
                     <p n="43">43. To return. <hi>Tarquinius</hi> finding that the People were out of Humour for being oblig'd to Work at the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Capitol and such mean sort of Work, had a mind to break the resenting Spirit with a design to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify his own Avarice, and march'd them out against <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea</hi> a <hi>Rutilan</hi> City richly stor'd with plenty of all things. While he lay before this Town, <hi>Sextus</hi> his eldest Son ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish'd <hi>Lucretia</hi> Wife to <hi>Tarquinius Collatinus,</hi> the resentment of which Piece of wickedness went so high that the King and his whole Family were expell'd the Kingdom. This <hi>Tarquinius Collatinus</hi> was the Son of that <hi>Collatia,</hi> whom <hi>Tarquinius Priscus</hi> took from the <hi>Latins</hi> and gave to <hi>Egerius</hi> his Posthumous Grandson, the Father of this Man.</p>
                     <p n="44">44. The chief Authors of the King's Exile, were <hi>Lucretius</hi> the Father of <hi>Lucretia, Publius Valerius,</hi> and <hi>L. Junius Brutus</hi> the Son of <hi>Marcus Junius</hi> who descended of one of <hi>Aeneas</hi>'s retinue. This <hi>Marcus Junius</hi> married <hi>Tarquinia</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Tarquinius Priscus,</hi> by whom
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:136207:91"/> he had this <hi>Lucius;</hi> and afterwards <hi>Tarquinius Superbus</hi> put him and his eldest Son to Death, in order to possess himself of his Estate. <hi>Lucius,</hi> upon the Death of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the loss of his patrimony, was constrain'd to act the Part of a Fool, and was thereupon Sirnam'd <hi>Brutus:</hi> but being a Man of a shrewd Genius, he diligently watch'd the opportunity of taking off the Tyrant. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly when <hi>Lucretia</hi> laid violent Hands on herself, and <hi>Collatinus</hi> discover'd the Plot to him, he took the bloody Knife in his Hand, and perswaded all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to swear by <hi>Mars</hi> and the other Gods, to expell <hi>Tarquinius</hi> and his Offspring, and never to suffer another King in <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="45">45. After <hi>Brutus</hi> had laid open the Method for execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the design, the Conspirators enter'd into a debate upon the future form of Government At length they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to the opinion of one, who acknowledg'd that they could not fall upon a better form and Method, than that chalk'd out by <hi>Romulus, Pompilius,</hi> and the other Kings; under which the Government was happily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minstred, till <hi>Tarquinius</hi> departed from their example. Besides, he thought that there were some things that occasion'd the degeneracy of the Kingdom into a Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and mov'd that these should be quite abolish'd; that the name of <hi>Kingdom</hi> should be shifted for that of a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick;</hi> and that Modester Words should be us'd for <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Monarchy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="46">46. His Model was, that not one but two should sit at the Helm of Affairs, and that the more Splendid Badges of Majesty, which inflam'd the People's Jealousy, should be quite laid aside, excepting on triumphal and festival Days. Such Badges were the Scepters, the Crowns of Gold, and purple Garments. He allow'd the use of the Ivory Chair of State, the <hi>Praetexta</hi> or white Garment border'd with Purple, and Serjeants carrying the Rods of State and Axes. Moreover, the Opinion was that the perpetual Power was by no means to be indur'd; but, that a Yearly Power was infinitly more suitable both to Modesty and Liberty. But at the same time, in order to keep up the name of a <hi>King,</hi> he propos'd that
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:136207:92"/> the Title of <hi>Rex Sacrorum</hi> should be conferr'd upon some Noblemen, who should have the Charge of Religious Worship.</p>
                     <p n="47">47. <hi>Brutus</hi> having obtain'd an act of the Senate for his purpose, calls together the People, and exposes to to their view the Corps of <hi>Lucretia</hi> stain'd with Blood and Gore. Then he took occasion to exaggerate the Charge against the <hi>Tarquinij,</hi> and made it out at large, that both the People and Senate were monstrously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd. He told 'em, that neither the Temper of his Sons, nor the Humour of <hi>Tarquinius</hi> would permit them to hope for amendment; and that the business they were about might easily be put in Execution. By which means he obtain'd a <hi>Plebiscitum</hi> for expelling <hi>Tarquinius</hi> and all his Offspring, and prohibiting any Man, under the Pain of Death, to countenance their Restoration either by Words or Actions.</p>
                     <p n="48">48. This was concluded upon in the Convention of the Wards or <hi>Comitia Curiata;</hi> and besides it was agreed upon that 2 Men chosen by the Convention of the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies or <hi>Comitia Centuriata</hi> should govern the Republick. <hi>Brutus</hi> nominated one <hi>Sp. Lucretius</hi> as Regent and Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the Meeting, who remov'd the Convention to the <hi>Campus Martius,</hi> and put up <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Collatinus</hi> as Candidats for the Office of yearly Kings. The Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries back'd the Proposal <hi>nemine contradicente.</hi> Then a Messenger was dispatch'd to the Camp to sollicit the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to revolt.</p>
                     <p n="49">49. The King came post to <hi>Rome,</hi> but finding the Gates shut upon him return'd to the Fields, where his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers likewise refus'd him admittance; so that in his Old Age, his Hairs being already gray, he was forc'd to submit to banishment, in the 244th Year after the building of the City according to <hi>Cato,</hi> but according to <hi>Terentius Varro</hi> the 245th; in the end of the 67th or beginning of the 68th Olympiad, A.M. 3496. <hi>Plinius</hi> says, <hi>Tarquinius</hi> was expell'd in the same Year that the <hi>Pisistratidae</hi> were outted of <hi>Athens,</hi> and <hi>Clemens</hi> casts it into the same time that <hi>Darius</hi> the Son of <hi>Hystaspes</hi> took <hi>Babylon.</hi> These things happen'd about 20 Years after <hi>Cyrus</hi> put an end to the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun the <hi>Persian,</hi> Monarchy.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Cambyses,</hi> succeeding his Father, marched presently with his Forces against <hi>Amasis</hi> King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> either because he had courted his Daughter, and yet married the Daughter of <hi>Apries,</hi> or else, which is more likely, because he look'd upon himself as Successor by right of War to <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> who conquer'd <hi>Egypt,</hi> tho this pretension is carefully conceal'd by the Priests. Having got a safe passage through <hi>Arabia,</hi> by vertue of the King's assistance, he compass'd his end without any difficulty. For <hi>Amases</hi> being then dead, his Son <hi>Psammitichus</hi> succeeded him, who being overpower'd by the <hi>Persian</hi> Forces was forc'd to submit; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards during his Captivity was constrained to drink Bulls-blood, for plotting innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

He march'd himself against the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to take sufficient Provisions along with him, was oblig'd to return with his Army, after they had eaten every 10th Man: and as for the expedition against the <hi>Ammonians,</hi> 50000 Men employ'd in it were buried in heaps of Sand. Upon all these disasters, he return'd to <hi>Memphis,</hi> destroy'd all the sacred things among the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and married two of his own Sisters.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He had sent his Brother back to <hi>Persia,</hi> because he only was able to bend the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Bow: But for so much as he saw in his sleep a messenger who told him that <hi>Smerdis</hi> sat upon the Throne, he gave orders to kill him: And when his youngest Sister being with child charg'd him with the parricide, he kill'd her with a kick of his heels. 'Tis worth while to take notice of the answer given in by the Judges, when <hi>Cambyses</hi> put the question to them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no there was any Law that allow'd him to Marry his Sister; 'Twas, <hi>that indeed the Persians had no such Law; but there was one extant, which empower'd the King to do what he pleas'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. When <hi>Cambyses</hi> treated his relations so barbarously, <hi>Patizithes</hi> a Magician, who was Governour of his Household, and acquainted with the manner of <hi>Smerdis</hi>'s death, having a

He left no issue.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Smerdis</hi> the Magician (called <hi>Mardus Sphendadates</hi> and <hi>Oropastes</hi>) reign d those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven months which were wanting to compleat the 8th year of <hi>Cambyses.</hi> For, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the King on his Death-bed discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the whole Intrigue, and earnestly entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all the Noblemen about him to punish the Magician, yet they did not believe him, because <hi>Praxaspes,</hi> the Minister im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to execute the Parricide, had not yet made any discovery. Afterwards, finding that <hi>Smerdis</hi> avoided showing himself, they began to smell out the matter, and the whole Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture was discovered by the Daughter of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:136207:95"/>
                     <hi>Otanes,</hi> who was Concubine to the Magician and to <hi>Cambyses;</hi> the mark she discovered him by was the cropping of his Ears, having call'd to mind that <hi>Cyrus</hi> had cut off the Ears of <hi>Smerdis</hi> the Magician.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whereupon seven Noble <hi>Persians</hi> conspired against the Magician, namely <hi>Otanes, Aspa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines, Gobryas, Intaphernes, Megabyzus, Hydar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> and <hi>Darius.</hi> They rush'd into the Palace, and kill'd the Magicians without any difficulty. Then they concerted measures concerning the Administration of the Government. Several forms of Government were started and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd of. At last <hi>Darius</hi>'s proposal of a Monarchy was most generally lik'd. In order therefore to pitch upon a King, they agreed to ride out into the Suburbs next morning, and that he, whose Horse neighed first, should be invested with <hi>Cambyses</hi> his Empire.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Darius</hi> got the Empire thro the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of his Groom, who had put his Horse to a Mare in the same place over-night. He was the Son of <hi>Hystaspes,</hi> Son of <hi>Arsamnes,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Cambyses, Cyrus</hi>'s Father. Tho he was invested with the Government, yet it seems 'twas only a sort of perpetual Dictator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, so that the others retain'd a power like to that of Tribunes. For the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and other Histories make mention of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kings intervening between the slaughter of the Magicians and his Reign; and say that at length he cut off the Conspirators, which it is probable he did out of fear and envy. In the second year of his Reign, by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:136207:95"/> and upon his charges, they set about the rebuilding of the Temple of <hi>Jerusalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. He divided the Kingdom into 20 Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, call'd by the <hi>Persians Satrapiae,</hi> and was the first that laid Taxes upon every one of them, so that as <hi>Cyrus</hi> was call'd <hi>Father,</hi> and <hi>Cambyses Lord, Darius</hi> was stil'd Factor. He punish'd <hi>Intaphernes</hi> with the loss of his Head for entring the Palace by offering vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to the Porters. In the 18th year of his reign the <hi>Babylonians</hi> rebell'd, being animated by the strength of their Walls, which <hi>Cyrus</hi> had left as Invincible, and by the successless Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions of <hi>Cambyses,</hi> and the Imposture of the Magicians. Having singl'd out some Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to bake bread for them, they slew all the rest, bating their own Mothers; and thus thinking themselves Invincible, they contemn'd the <hi>Persians,</hi> and stood out▪ against all their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks for 19 months.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. At length <hi>Zopyrus</hi> the Son of <hi>Megabyzus</hi> pretended to desert, his Nose being cut off, as if <hi>Darius</hi> had us'd him so; and being readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertain'd by the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> was made their Governour, and betrayed the Town into the hands of the King. Then the Walls were le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled with the ground, 3000 of the Citizens were crucified, and the rest were furnished with 5000 Women, in order to repair the loss of their kind. The Town it self was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>Zopyrus</hi> as a reward for so great an Exploit.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Darius</hi> being Master of <hi>Babylon</hi> invaded the <hi>Scythians,</hi> in order to make his reprisals, for their possessing themselves of <hi>Asia</hi> 28
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:136207:96"/> years in the reign of <hi>Cyaxares</hi> the <hi>Median,</hi> or else to resent the repulse he met with in courting the Daughter of King <hi>Lanthius.</hi> He could not by any means come up with his Enemy, for the <hi>Scythians</hi> to this very day inhabit no City nor Town, but are scattered up and down the Country, feeding their Cattle. At length after many disappointments and decoys, he es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped narrowly, and return'd home without any memorable action.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. He had left <hi>Megabyzus</hi> the Son of <hi>Zopy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> at the Head of an Army of 80000 Men. He conquered the <hi>Perinthians</hi> and <hi>Peonians,</hi> and sent Ambassadors to <hi>Amyntas</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia</hi> to demand free Passage. But they were kill'd in revenge of their wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonness, by the contrivance of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Kings Son, and so never returned: and <hi>Bubares</hi> the <hi>Persian</hi> who was sent with an Army to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand what the matter was, fell in love with <hi>Gygea</hi> the Kings Daughter, and married her, and in Complement to his Father-in-law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed the murder.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. In the 16 year of <hi>Darius, Otanes</hi> was put into <hi>Megabyzus</hi>'s place, who took the Citys of <hi>Chalcedon; Byzantium</hi> (or <hi>Constantinople</hi>) and <hi>Tandros,</hi> together with the Islands <hi>Lemnos</hi> and <hi>Imbros.</hi> But soon after the <hi>Persian</hi> inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest was mightily mortified by the revoult of the <hi>Ionians.</hi> The Author of that revoult was <hi>Aristagoras</hi> Tyrant of <hi>Miletus,</hi> who had lately been disoblig'd by the <hi>Persians,</hi> and was push'd on by <hi>Histieus</hi> his Father-in-law, a <hi>Milesian</hi> Prince, and a man of a ready Wit, whom <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> out of policy had carried along with him to <hi>Suse.</hi>

                     <pb n="189" facs="tcp:136207:96"/>9. <hi>Histieus</hi> preferring the Government of one little Town to his splendid bondage, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to set <hi>Ionia</hi> in fire, thinking that he would be sent to quench it. In pursuance of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, he shaved the head of a trusty Servant of his, and with a hot Iron imprinted certain marks of his design upon it; and when his hair was grown, sent him to <hi>Miletus</hi> with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders only to tell <hi>Aristagoras</hi> to shave his head. By this means <hi>Aristagoras</hi> received the advice that he had mightily long'd for, and readily influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd the <hi>Ionians</hi> to rebellion.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. The <hi>Athenians</hi> sided with the <hi>Ionians,</hi> and their Tyrant <hi>Hippias,</hi> then at the Court of <hi>Persia,</hi> us'd all means to incense <hi>Darius</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. They sent 20 Ships to assist them, besides five sent by the <hi>Eretrians.</hi> This was the beginning of that infinite number of evils, which put an end to the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire. This <hi>Ionian</hi> War happened in the 19th year of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> the 2 year of the 69 Olympiad, 507 years before Christ, <hi>A. M.</hi> 3502.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. With the naval forces mentioned but now, <hi>Aristagoras</hi> quickly took <hi>Sardis,</hi> which was laid in ashes by the firing of one house. <hi>Artaphernes, Darius</hi>'s Brother, continued Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Castle. But the <hi>Grecians</hi> were put to the flight, when the tumult occasioned by the fire set the <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Lydians</hi> to fight. Many were kill'd upon the flight, and <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> could by no means hinder the <hi>Athenians</hi> from returning home.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. <hi>Cyprus</hi> indeed sided with the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and <hi>Histieus</hi> did so far over-reach <hi>Darius,</hi> that he got leave to be gone. But presently their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:136207:97"/> became more desperate. For at the end of one year <hi>Cyprus</hi> was recover'd by the <hi>Persians,</hi> and the Governours of the Provinces that had married the K.'s Daughters, having divided the <hi>Ionian</hi> Towns among themselves, got most of 'em; whereupon <hi>Aristagoras,</hi> designing to flee into <hi>Thracia,</hi> was kill'd.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. The Governours having reduced all the <hi>Ionians</hi> that lived above the <hi>Hellespont,</hi> to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>'s Government, besieged <hi>Miletus,</hi> both by Sea and Land. The <hi>Ionian</hi> Ambassadors, out of regard to the <hi>Panionian</hi> Council, resolv'd to fit out a gallant Navy, to make-head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, and not to trouble themselves with the levying of Land-forces. But the <hi>Persian</hi> Officers did so dexterously imploy their interest with the <hi>Samian</hi> Tyrants, that the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians</hi> observing the lazy backwardness of the rest, gave them the slip, in hopes of obtaining pardon: and at last the others followed their example.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. <hi>Miletus</hi> being block'd up, was at length carried by Mines, and other strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems usual in the Sieges of Towns; and was quite demolish'd in the 6th. year after their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt. <hi>Histieus</hi> being toss'd up and down, was at last taken Prisoner in the Field, by <hi>Harpagus</hi> the <hi>Persian:</hi> His body was nail'd to a Cross by <hi>Artaphernes,</hi> and his head was sent to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> who was much disturb'd at the death of so Great a Man. Thus were the <hi>Ionians</hi> thrice Conquer'd, once by the <hi>Lydians,</hi> and twice by the <hi>Persians.</hi>

Tho the Commotions of the <hi>Ionians</hi> were now asleep, and the Ring leaders of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion punish'd, yet <hi>Darius</hi> had no mind to put up the Affair, while the <hi>Athenians</hi> boldness pass'd with impunity, and the destruction of <hi>Sardes</hi> was unresented, which incens'd him so much against them, that he order'd his Servant while he sat at Table, always to cry out, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster remember the</hi> Athenians. First he sent Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors to <hi>Greece,</hi> to demand Provisions from the Cities; whom the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> threw head-long into Pits. Then he sent <hi>Dates,</hi> the <hi>Median,</hi> and <hi>Artaphernes,</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Son; at the head of a gallant Army a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Their orders were to lay <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retria</hi> waste, and to bring the Inhabitants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. <hi>Eretria</hi> indeed was taken by Treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery; but when they march'd against the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians,</hi> they were routed by them, under the Command of <hi>Miltiades,</hi> in that great Battle which was fought in the <hi>Marathonian</hi> Fields, in the 2d. or 3d. year of the 72d.

                  <p n="17">17. <hi>Darius,</hi> notwithstanding this unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Expedition against the <hi>Athenians,</hi> design'd to make tryal of another. Accordingly, about 4 years after, when the <hi>Egyptians</hi> rebell'd, he made great Preparations, in order to make head against both the one and the other, and was just ready to take the Field, when the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom of his Country oblig'd him to declare his Successor, before he set out.</p>
                  <p n="18">
                     <pb n="192" facs="tcp:136207:98"/>18. <hi>Artibazanes,</hi> (alias <hi>Artamenes</hi> and <hi>Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi>) his eldest Son, by the Daughter of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryas,</hi> who bore him three besides, put in for the Succession: But <hi>Xerxes,</hi> his Son by <hi>Atossa,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> had the better of him. <hi>Darius</hi> just ready to march against the <hi>Grecians,</hi> was prevented by Death, in the latter end of the 1st. year of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Revolt, the 3d. year of the 73d. Olympiad, the 28th. year of his Reign, 495 years before the Christian date, A. M. 3519.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. <hi>Xerxes,</hi> the 4th. King of the <hi>Persians,</hi> Succeeded to the Empire of his Ancestors. <hi>Herodotus</hi> tells us, his name signifies a Warriour, as <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> signifies a great Warriour. His Father having left all things in a readiness for War, the next year he recover'd <hi>Egypt,</hi> and having put it under a harder yoke, made <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamenes,</hi> his Brother, Governour of it.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. Being encourag'd by this success, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to attack the <hi>Grecians,</hi> pursuant to the advice of one <hi>Mardonius,</hi> a Cousin of his; and slighted the grave remonstrances of his Uncle <hi>Artabanus,</hi> who preach'd up moderation to him upon the account of the inconstancy of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affairs. He was farther encourag'd to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on that design by the solicitations of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levadae</hi> or <hi>Thessalian</hi> Princes, who envied the <hi>Grecian</hi> Liberty, and the <hi>Pisistratidae,</hi> who had a spiteful eye upon <hi>Athens.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="21">21. In order to carry on this War, such mighty preparations were made for 4 years together, that <hi>Asia</hi> seem'd to be mov'd out of its place. At length, in the 4th. year of the 73d▪ Olympiad, and the 5th. of his own Reign,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:136207:98"/> he set out from <hi>Suse,</hi> and took up his Winter Quarters at <hi>Sardes.</hi> Lest his Fleet, consisting of 12000 Ships, shou'd be cast away in sailing round the Mountain <hi>Atho,</hi> he converted it into an Island, by digging a ditch of such a breadth that two Galleys abreast might go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long it. In the beginning of the Spring he came to <hi>Abydos,</hi> where a day was turn'd into night by a sudden darkness, without any E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse of the Sun. Having laid Bridges over the <hi>Hellespont,</hi> he transported his Army into <hi>Europe</hi> in seven days time, and march'd from thence to the Plains of <hi>Dariscus,</hi> where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view'd his Naval and Land Forces.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. The World never saw nor heard of so great a number of Soldiers in one Body. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the review a List was given in of 2317910 Souls, and yet he plac'd such confidence in mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Men, that he requir'd all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from <hi>Dariscus</hi> to <hi>Greece,</hi> to rise up in Arms, by which means his Naval force was enlarg'd by the accession of 120 Ships, and 24000 Men, and his Land force was encreas'd by 300000: So that the total number of his Men, at this rate, amounted to 2641610, and it is thought that was follow'd by an equal number of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and other Retainers to the Camp: So that there was in all 5283220 Persons that Travell'd over Land to the Straits of <hi>Thermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pylae,</hi> and came by Sea to <hi>Sepias.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="23">23. As for their Women that bak'd their Bread, their Concubines, Eunuchs, their Beasts for Carriage, and their <hi>Indian</hi> Dogs, their number cannot be determin'd. So that it is no wonder if whole Rivers did not suffice this
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:136207:99"/> stupendious multitude. It is rather to be wonder'd that a heavier Plague did not Reign among them, that Sedition and Mutinies did not prevail, and that Famine did not sweep 'em off.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. The <hi>Grecians</hi> were well acquainted with all these motions, bating a few that sided with the <hi>Persians;</hi> whereupon they put up all their mutual Contests, and having enter'd into a Confederacy, sent <hi>Leonidas,</hi> the King of <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demon,</hi> to defend the <hi>Thermopylae,</hi> who, with a handful of Men, put a stop to the passage of the <hi>Persians,</hi> till they got over the Hills, and attack'd his Rear. <hi>Xerxes</hi> had no sooner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd <hi>Greece,</hi> but his Affairs began to have a worse Aspect than before; for he was defeated in a Sea fight at <hi>Artemisium,</hi> after the loss of 400 Ships.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. His Army being divided, that part which was sent to <hi>Delphi,</hi> was almost all of it knock'd down with Thunder-bolts, and two Rocks that fell from <hi>Parnassus;</hi> the other part march'd towards <hi>Athens,</hi> under the Command of the King himself: Which being unpeopled and abandon'd, he took and set it on fire. But soon after, his Fleet, tho' recruited and enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged was routed by the <hi>Grecians,</hi> in a sharp En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement at the Island <hi>Salamine,</hi> and quite lost.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. <hi>Xerxes</hi> being cast down by this disaster, saw it necessary for him to flee, least the <hi>Ionians,</hi> who sided with the <hi>Grecians,</hi> shou'd break his Bridge over the <hi>Hellespont.</hi> And here we meet with a notable instance of Divine Vengeance; he, who a little while before was so fierce as

                  <p n="28">28. <hi>Mardonius</hi> was the Man that advis'd this War, and in order to clear himself from the imputations that might ensue upon the success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Adventure, perswaded the King to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Asia,</hi> which he knew the King would willingly do, and of his own accord undertook to compleat the remaining part of the design, with the Forces that were left: According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, being mindful of his promise, when he cou'd not by any means perswade the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> to submit, he march'd out of <hi>Thessaly,</hi> invaded <hi>Attica,</hi> routed the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and laid the Town and Country once more waste. But finding the Country Mountainous, and not proper for his Horse, he return'd to <hi>Beotia,</hi> where the <hi>Grecians</hi> drew together, in order to make head against him.</p>

                  <p n="30">30. <hi>Mardonius</hi> being kill'd, the <hi>Persians</hi> threw down both their Courage and their Arms, and run for't. <hi>Artabazus,</hi> with a Body of 40000 Men, made the best of his way to the <hi>Hellespont.</hi> The rest return'd to their Camp, which, at last, was Storm'd, and almost all of 'em put to the Sword. For, of all the 300000 which <hi>Xerxes</hi> left, bating those who went off with <hi>Artabazus,</hi> there was but 3000 sav'd; and <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus Siculus</hi> tells us, that 10000 had their Throats cut within their own Trenches.

                  <p n="34">34. <hi>Xerxes</hi> took his disaster so ill, that (as the story has it) he set all the Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> on fire, excepting that of <hi>Diana</hi> at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.</hi> For the envy of that wicked incestuous Person, rose in proportion to the contempt he was brought under, by his dishonourable flight.

In order to this end, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after he had kill'd the King, he went to <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> and told him that <hi>Darius</hi> his Brother had a design upon him, whereupon he sent a party to dispatch <hi>Darius</hi> out of the way.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But after seven months (which <hi>Eusebius</hi> makes the period of his reign) he was killed himself, together with his Complices, upon offering to attack <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi> By this means the Government came into the hands of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes,</hi>

This happen'd in the 4th. year of the 78 Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad, or the beginning of the 79th, while <hi>Lysitheus</hi> was <hi>Archon,</hi> 463 years before Christ, A. M. 3540.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the Reign of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> the <hi>Bactri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> rebell'd, but were quickly reduc'd. The <hi>Egyptians</hi> gave him more trouble, who sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected themselves to <hi>Inarus,</hi> King of <hi>Libya,</hi> and routed <hi>Achaemenes,</hi> the Son of <hi>Darius,</hi> who was sent against 'em with a most nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Army; and block'd up the sorry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of his army so that they cou'd not get off. <hi>Megabyzus</hi> Son to that <hi>Zopyrus</hi> who took <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Artabazus,</hi> were sent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them: Accordingly they rais'd the Siege, defeated the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> recover'd the whole Country, bating some marshy places, and took <hi>Inarus</hi> Prisoner, and crucify'd him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Valour of the <hi>Athenians</hi> upon this occasion was very remarkable: When their Ships were lying in the road of <hi>Byblus,</hi> in order to assist the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> the <hi>Persians</hi> drain'd the Water out of the Channel of the River, by ditches; and by that means left the Fleet upon dry ground. But the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi> exhorted and encourag'd one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be guilty of nothing beneath the Character of a <hi>Grecian;</hi> and set their Ships on fire: and with an undaunted Courage dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd themselves for fighting: Whereupon, the <hi>Persians</hi> suffer'd them to get off, tho' they were but 6000 Men. Thus they return'd
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:136207:102"/> home, after they had been engag'd in a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesless War 6 years.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> in the 7th. year of his reign, publish'd an Edict, allowing the <hi>Jews</hi> to go and dwell at <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> and liberally furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with all necessaries, leaving the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution of 'em to the discretion of <hi>Ezra,</hi> the Priest. This Edict mentions nothing of building the Walls; yet it is not to be doubted, but the King design'd it, since the Inhabitants and Builders of the Temple, could not be safe otherwise.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If matters stand so, then the beginning of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s 70 weeks must be dated from this Juncture. These weeks consisted of 490 years, terminating in the death of our Lord Jesus Christ. Indeed there are many various Opinions, concerning the beginning and the end of these years; but they go upon weak grounds. However, if we reckon from this 7th. year of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> down thro' the Reigns of the <hi>Persian</hi> and <hi>Macedonian</hi> Kings, the <hi>Hasmonaei,</hi> and of <hi>Herod</hi> the Great; or, thro' the series of the Olympiads, and the years of <hi>Rome</hi>'s standing, down to the death of Christ; The whole will amount to 490 years, without any great odds. But of this more in our large History.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. In the 20th. year of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> upon the News that the Walls of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> were thrown down, the Gates set on fire, and the People mightily oppress'd; <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> a <hi>Jew</hi> and Cupbearer to the King, was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dispatch'd, by virtue of the old Edict,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:136207:102"/> there being no necessity of a new one, to repair the Walls, and put the republick in order.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The years accruing from the New Moon in the Month <hi>Nisan,</hi> immediately after the reparation of the Walls, to the New Moon of the Month of Christ's Passion, amount to 475 of the Julian form, which make 490 Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar years. 'Twas upon this account that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Learned Men follow'd the opinion of <hi>Africanus,</hi> who reckon'd the course of <hi>Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>'s weeks, as running from this year to the death of Christ. But he reckon'd 475 years from this time to the Reign of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> whereas, there was only 472, and Christ did not dye, but was baptis'd in the 15th. year of <hi>Tiberius.</hi>

The <hi>Athenians</hi> recall'd <hi>Cimon</hi> from his Exile, and sent him with 200 Ships against <hi>Cyprus,</hi> which was then subject to the <hi>Persian.</hi> He detach'd 60 out of that number for <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> to assist <hi>Amyrtaeus,</hi> and with the rest block'd up <hi>Citium.</hi>

Peace being concluded with the <hi>Grecians, Megabyzus</hi> rais'd up a Civil War, which, after several Engagements, was at length brought to an end. <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> having reign'd 41 years, dy'd in the 2d. year of the 98th.

                  <p n="14">14. <hi>Cyrus</hi> had scarce Govern'd 2 years, when he was so transported with Prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that he put to death <hi>Autobaesaces</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traeus,</hi> his own kinsmen, because in their approaches to him, they did not keep up their hands within their Garments, which was usual in making Addresses to the King.

                  <p n="22">22. <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> having thus put his Affairs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a peaceable state, bended his mind upon the recovery of the Cities that had revolted.

They sent an Embassy to <hi>Tissaphernes,</hi> which he slighted; whereupon they sent <hi>Thimbrones</hi> with an Army against him; but <hi>Thimbrones</hi> being misfortunate, was soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter degraded and banish'd. <hi>Dercyllidas</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him: who by reason of his extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary sagacity was sirnam'd <hi>Sisyphus.</hi> He soon perceiv'd that he had two Generals to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter; and therefore endeavour'd to gain one of them; by which means he rais'd such a jealousie between the two, that <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> (one of 'em) went home to the King, and accus'd <hi>Tissaphernes</hi> (whom <hi>Dercyllidas</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd) of Treachery. Upon his solicitation, <hi>Conon,</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> was made Admiral of the Fleet. After that, orders were given to invade <hi>Caria, Tissaphernes</hi>'s Province, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon an Interview was agreed to, and a Truce concluded upon, in order to a Peace.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. However, the Truce did not retard the building of a new fleet in <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> which was given out as consisting of 300 Ships. Upon the News whereof, <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> King of <hi>Sparta,</hi> was sent into <hi>Asia:</hi> and he made use of <hi>Lysander</hi> for his Ambassador, a man that was admirably well vers'd in Military Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, who, by his celebrated Victory of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> had put an end to the <hi>Peloponne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> War.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. <hi>Agesilaus</hi> behav'd himself so well, that he was likewise made Admiral of the Navy. He did so over-reach <hi>Tissaphernes,</hi> and fought so successfully in his absence, that <hi>Tissaphernes</hi>
                     <pb n="208" facs="tcp:136207:106"/> was again charg'd with Treachery, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd with the loss of his Life. The Fleet being fitted out, <hi>Agesilaus</hi> flatter'd himself with the hopes of turning the <hi>Persian</hi> out of <hi>Asia. Tithraustes, Tissaphernes</hi>'s Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor, having notice of the project, saw there was no other way of diverting the design, but that of giving the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> so much trouble at home, that they were obliged to to recall their King, for the relief of his Country.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. In pursuance of this thought, he sent <hi>Timocrates,</hi> the <hi>Rhodian,</hi> with 50 Talents of Gold into <hi>Greece,</hi> in order to bribe the heads of Factions, and tempt 'em to make War with the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi> This project took so well, that in the space of 1 year, a great Conspiracy broke out against the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> which occasion'd so great a War, that they were oblig'd to recall their King. He was mightily troubled for being oblig'd to return, just when he was setting out for the upper Provinces, whom the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his name it self would have retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and was hugging himself in the happy issue of all his labour and hopes.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. However, his regard to his Country outweigh'd all other Considerations, and his stedfast opinion was, that a General was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd to obey the Laws and the Magistrates. Upon his departure from <hi>Asia,</hi> he said in a merry humour, that 30000 Archers had beat him out of <hi>Asia,</hi> alluding to so many pieces of Money, bearing the Effigies of an Archer, with which they had purchas'd the War against the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="28">
                     <pb n="209" facs="tcp:136207:106"/>28. Notwithstanding that <hi>Agesilaus</hi> was recall'd, the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> were so routed by <hi>Conon</hi> at Sea, and so much oppress'd at home, that they began to fear that the <hi>Athenians</hi> might recover their former Power; and thereupon made Peace with the King, by the Ministry of <hi>Antalcidas;</hi> whence it was call'd <hi>Pax Antalcidae. Arta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xerxes</hi> by this means being free of the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> War, and having put his Affairs in a pretty good order, pointed the dint of his Arms towards <hi>Cyprus,</hi> which <hi>Evagoras</hi> had almost master'd.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. <hi>Evagoras</hi> was overcome at Sea; but the <hi>Persian</hi> Officers happening to Quarrel among themselves, a Peace was agreed upon about 2 years after, after the laying out of 50 Talents upon the War. And by this means <hi>Evagoras</hi> peacefully enjoy'd the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of his former possessions. After that <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> wag'd War with the <hi>Cadusians,</hi> but with small success. In the mean time <hi>Egypt</hi> had revolted for several years. When he set about the reducing of it, he carry'd on his designs pretty happily, till a private Quarrel between <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> and <hi>Iphicrates,</hi> ruin'd it.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. In the mean time the <hi>Grecians</hi> were mutually engag'd in Civil Wars, which he endeavour'd to adjust, thinking to get as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance from them against the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> But the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were so angry with him for including <hi>Messene</hi> in the Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that they sent relief to <hi>Achoris,</hi> King of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Besides, the <hi>Grecian</hi> Towns in
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:136207:107"/>
                     <hi>Asia,</hi> made head against him, and occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the revolt of several <hi>Satrapae.</hi> Indeed the <hi>Satrapae</hi> were soon after betray'd by <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rontes,</hi> their head; but he was not able to recover <hi>Egypt,</hi> notwithstanding the divisions it lay under, which were occasion'd by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious pretensions to the Crown.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> had 115 Sons, but 3 of them only by lawful Marriage, namely, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, Ariaspes</hi> and <hi>Ochus.</hi> The rest were born of Concubines, of whom he kept 360; tho' ev'n that number did not satisfie him, for he added to it, by the incestuous pollution of his own Daughters. In his old Age he check'd <hi>Ochus</hi> for aspiring to the Kingdom, and took in <hi>Darius,</hi> the eldest, then 50 years old, as partner with him. But <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> courted <hi>Aspasia, Cyrus</hi>'s Mistress, whom the King had married; and being rejected, took that for an Affront, and enter'd into a Conspiracy with 50 of his Brethren against his Father. The Plot being discover'd, he and all his Complices were punished with death.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. Upon the death of <hi>Darius, Ochus</hi> aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at the Crown more eagerly, but was much afraid of two of his Brethren, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Ariaspes,</hi> the eldest lawful Son, and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samis,</hi> a bastard, whom the Father doated on for his Wit and Capacity. He continually gave it out, that <hi>Ariaspes</hi> was quickly to be put to death, by his Father's orders, and by this means provok'd him to poison him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; and at the same time took care to see <hi>Arsamis</hi> kill'd by <hi>Harpates,</hi> the Son of
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:136207:107"/>
                     <hi>Teribazus,</hi> who lost his Life in <hi>Darius</hi> his Plot.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> was acquainted with all these things, but being worn out with Age, could not pursue them. His grief and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of mind was such, that he sunk under it, and dy'd in the 94th. year of his Age, the 43d. of his Reign, the 3d. of the 104th. Olympiad, 360 years before the birth of Christ, A. M. 3944. His Subjects reckon'd him the meekest of Men, especially upon the account, that the cruellest of Parricides was his Successor.</p>

He is said to have concealed his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's death for 10 months, till all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were satisfied, by the sending about the Royal Seal, that <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> had nominated <hi>Ochus</hi> for his Successor. Having purchas'd the Kingdom by Wickedness, he resolv'd to establish it by more of the same stamp: Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he fill'd the Palace with Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:136207:108"/> Murders, without any regard to Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Blood, Affinity, Sex or Age.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Artabazus</hi> revolted from <hi>Ochus,</hi> and by the help of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> defeated several of his Armies, which obliged the King to make Peace with them. <hi>Egypt</hi> had thrown off the <hi>Persian</hi> yoke a long while ago; but <hi>Ochus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unfit for War, did easily sit with the loss. But, after all, in the 11th. year of his Reign, when the <hi>Phenicians</hi> and <hi>Cyprians</hi> likewise revolted, and enter'd into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy with the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> he took up new resolutions, and purpos'd to reduce the Rebels.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Having drawn together an Army of 300000 Foot, and 30000 Horse, and fitted out a Fleet of 300 Ships, he march'd into <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> where <hi>Sidon</hi> was surrender'd into his hands, by the Treachery of <hi>Tennes</hi> their King; and the Treacherous King lost his head: But the Inhabitants finding the Town lost, set it and themselves on fire, and it is said 40000 Men perish'd in the flames. <hi>Ochus</hi> being animated by this success, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with that in <hi>Cyprus,</hi> which he had reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd by the good services of <hi>Adrieus,</hi> Prince of <hi>Caria,</hi> invaded <hi>Egypt;</hi> and likewise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd it, by the good services of <hi>Mentor,</hi> a <hi>Rhodian.</hi> Having beat <hi>Nectanebus,</hi> their King, and carry'd off great spoil, he return'd home, Crown'd with Glory and Renown; and on his return carry'd off a great number of the Jews, some of whom he plac'd in <hi>Babylon,</hi> and others in <hi>Hyrcania,</hi> at the Caspian Sea.</p>

                     <pb n="213" facs="tcp:136207:108"/>4. <hi>Mentor</hi> reconcil'd <hi>Artabazus</hi> and several others with the King, and reduc'd the whole Kingdom to a peaceable state. At this time <hi>Philip,</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> flourish'd mightily, and besieg'd <hi>Perinthus,</hi> a Town in <hi>Thracia,</hi> situated upon the <hi>Propontis. Ochus</hi> being jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and afraid of the overgrown power of that King, and finding the <hi>Perinthians</hi> in a sad condition, order'd the Governours of the Maritim Provinces to give speedy and present relief to the besieged; by which means the hopes of, the <hi>Macedonian</hi> were frustrated. <hi>Alexander,</hi> the Son of <hi>Philip,</hi> did afterwards twitt the <hi>Persians</hi> with this, when they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of his incursion.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In the 9th. year of <hi>Ochus, Mausolus,</hi> Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy of <hi>Caria,</hi> dy'd without Issue; his Wife, <hi>Artemisia,</hi> built such a noble Tomb for him, that the <hi>Romans</hi> dignifi'd their Magnificent Buildings with the name of <hi>Mausolea.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Bagoas,</hi> an Eunuch, was so great a favourite of the King, that he dispos'd of every thing according to his pleasure. This <hi>Bagoas,</hi> who was an <hi>Egyptian,</hi> suborn'd <hi>Ochus</hi>'s Physitian to poison him, in the 23d. year of his reign; either out of the fear of <hi>Ochus</hi>'s cruelty, or in revenge of the death of <hi>Apis,</hi> the <hi>Egyptian</hi> King, whom <hi>Ochus</hi> had kill'd, or else in order to enlarge his own Authority and Power. He expos'd his Corps to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd by Cats, and bury'd another Carcass in the Royal Tomb; and, for an Emblem of the King's cruel temper, caus'd Sword hilts to be made of the Bones of his Legs.</p>

                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:136207:109"/>6. He set <hi>Arses,</hi> the Son of <hi>Ochus,</hi> upon the Throne, and kill'd all the other Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to the end that the new King being destitute of Friends, might depend upon him for support; but, in effect, <hi>Bagoas</hi> was the Man that reign'd, and usurp'd every thing belonging to the Crown, bating the name. When he perceiv'd that <hi>Arses</hi> took more than ordinary notice of things, he apprehended the danger of being call'd to an account; and in order to avoid it, slew him and all his Children, before the end of the 3d. year of his Reign.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. He heap'd up Wickedness upon Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, and added Parricide to Parricide, till the Royal Family became so desolate, that scarce any one remain'd to possess the Crown. Things being at this pass, he pitch'd upon one <hi>Codomannus,</hi> a Friend of his, whom some gave out to have been only a Steward, and an Alien to the Royal Family; but others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, he was the Son of <hi>Arsames,</hi> and Grand-Child to <hi>Ochus,</hi> by <hi>Sisygambe,</hi> their Sister or Kinswoman. <hi>Curtius</hi> writes, that the Father of this Woman and 80 of his Sons were bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barously put to death by <hi>Ochus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>Codomannus</hi> is said to have behav'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self bravely in the <hi>Cadusian</hi> War, and to have defeated his Enemy upon such an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary occasion, that the King reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with several Complements, together with the Government of <hi>Armenia;</hi> and the people at last elected him to be their King, and he was Christen'd <hi>Darius,</hi> that being a Title of greater Majesty and Honour. <hi>Bagoas</hi>
                     <pb n="215" facs="tcp:136207:109"/> quickly repented of what he had done, and resolved to add <hi>Darius</hi> to the number of the murder'd Princes: But the King perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the design, when he offer'd him the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, oblig'd him to drink it himself.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. <hi>Darius</hi> misfortunately fell into such times and aukward Circumstances, that the wisest of Men wou'd have found great difficulty to get clear of; and if we compare the Temper of this Prince, with the Genius of the Adversary he was oblig'd to encounter, we'll find it a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right impossibility for him to escape. The Kingdom of <hi>Macedonia</hi> was at this time advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the highest pitch of Grandeur, that the limits of <hi>Greece</hi> cou'd afford. <hi>Philip</hi> had all <hi>Greece</hi> at his beck, and under his Authority; and by the means of Schools for War and Sciences, had plac'd both <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> in his Camp: Whereas, the Monarchy of the <hi>Persians</hi> was a'most worn out with Age, and stagger'd under its own weight; in it the juice and blood of Sciences and Virtue dwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, and vanished into the vapour of Luxury.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. There were many Quarrels between the <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Grecians,</hi> besides the invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate feuds that the ravishing of the Women in ancient times occasion'd. The Expedition of the <hi>Athenians</hi> against <hi>Sardes,</hi> started new grudges, which the Adventures of <hi>Xerxes</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd. Besides, the riches of <hi>Asia</hi> were a great Temptation to the <hi>Grecians.</hi> They thought it was a shame that such great Possessions shou'd continue in the hands of such a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. After <hi>Xenophon</hi>'s return with a handful of Men, thro' so many Provinces, they always
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:136207:110"/> prefer'd the <hi>Grecian</hi> Steel to the <hi>Asiatick</hi> Gold. In short, the <hi>Grecians</hi> were mad with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable itch to pillage the riches of those Countries.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. <hi>Cimon</hi> indeed was the last of the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Generals; but <hi>Philip,</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> a Man equally entitled to Prudence and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Vertues, equall'd the Glory of the most renown'd Generals, and at this time kept <hi>Greece</hi> in bondage, under the pretence of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. When this great Prince divulg'd his purpose of making War with the <hi>Persian,</hi> the <hi>Grecians</hi> almost unanimously elected him to be their head, and Soldiers were levy'd in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry City.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. The next Spring he sent <hi>Parmenio, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myntas</hi> and <hi>Attalus</hi> before him into <hi>Asia,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretence of rescuing the <hi>Grecian</hi> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; himself, designing to follow, was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd by one <hi>Pausanias,</hi> at his Daughter's Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Upon his death <hi>Darius</hi> thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self secure, and slighted <hi>Alexander,</hi> the Son and Successor of <hi>Philip,</hi> who was then a youth of 20 years of Age.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. But <hi>Alexander</hi> had an invincible great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of mind, and did not fail to enlarge his Patrimony. He surmounted all difficulties in <hi>Greece,</hi> and cross'd the <hi>Hellespont,</hi> at the head of an Army of 31000 Foot, and 5100 Horse. <hi>Darius</hi> thought it not proper to overlook small things, and therefore sent an Army to oppose him; but flatter'd himself with the hopes of so great success, that in contempt of the Juvenile Ardour, he order'd that Boy
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:136207:110"/> to be first whip'd with rods, before he was brought into his presence.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. <hi>Memnon</hi> the <hi>Rhodian,</hi> a Man admirably well vers'd in Military Affairs, was made Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to the <hi>Persian</hi> Army. He was of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that they should by no means engage with <hi>Alexander,</hi> but stop his further progress by laying the Country waste all about him, and transfer the War (if possible) into their Enemies Kingdom, by invading <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia;</hi> by which means he wou'd be recall'd to defend his own Country. But the <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> slighted this seasonable advice, as being too mean and unworthy of their Honour and Valour, and thought it much more credita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to come to an Engagement: According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they attack'd <hi>Alexander,</hi> after he cross'd the River <hi>Granicus,</hi> and were routed, with the loss of 12000 Men.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. The fame of this Glorious Victory, procur'd him the easie Conquest of <hi>Asia.</hi> At <hi>Gordium,</hi> a Town in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> finding that he cou'd not untye <hi>Midas</hi>'s knot, he cut it with his Sword, and by that means either fulfilled or eluded the Oracle. <hi>Darius</hi> employ'd <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> his General, to draw together a new Army, and fit out a Fleet of 300 Ships. But <hi>Memnon</hi> in the mean time dy'd, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of <hi>Darius</hi> fell with him. The King finding none fit for the office, headed his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my himself. He march'd out of <hi>Babylon</hi> towards <hi>Cilicia</hi> at the head of an Army of 400000 Foot, and above 100000 Horse, together with his Mother, his Wife, his Son, then
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:136207:111"/> 6 years of Age, and two Marriageable Daughters.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. <hi>Darius</hi> pursu'd <hi>Alexander</hi> to the Straits of <hi>Cilicia,</hi> fancying that he declin'd Battle as the flatterers had suggested to him: He came up with <hi>Alexander</hi> near to <hi>Issus,</hi> where he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd with all his Force, and was routed, and oblig'd to flee, riding upon a Mare that had lately foal'd. There were 10000 <hi>Persians</hi> kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and 40000 taken Prisoners; whereas, the <hi>Macedonians</hi> scarce lost 300. Men. The Mother, Wife and Children of <hi>Darius</hi> were taken. This Battel happen'd in the month <hi>Maemacterion,</hi> while <hi>Lycostratus,</hi> or <hi>Nicocrates,</hi> was Archon, in the 4th. year of the 3d. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympiad, the 4th. of <hi>Darius,</hi> the 4th. of <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander,</hi> A. M. 2672.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. <hi>Darius</hi> being routed at <hi>Issus,</hi> many of his Governours went over to <hi>Alexander. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> wrote a Letter to the King of <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> about the ransoming of his Prisoners, and did not speak like one overcome, tho' this was the second time, but as if he had the better on't; neither did he deign to give his Adversary the Title of King. But his Adversary answer'd him bravely, and like a King. <hi>Alexander</hi> quickly reduc'd <hi>Syria,</hi> and all <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> excepting <hi>Tyrus,</hi> which he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards master'd, by an unheard of method.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. For the Town being situated in an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sland, he joyn'd it to the Continent by▪ Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks, and heaps of Earth. The Inhabitants defended themselves stoutly, and lost 7000 Men: The rest were taken Prisoners, of whom 20000 were put to death, and the Women
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:136207:111"/> and Children were sentenc'd to slavery; but there was 15000 of them entertain'd by the <hi>Sydonians,</hi> from whom a Nation did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards spring. <hi>Tyrus</hi> was taken in the month <hi>Hecatombaeon,</hi> while <hi>Annicetus,</hi> (alias, <hi>Nicera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> and <hi>Nicetas</hi>) was Archon; in the 1st. year of the 112th.

                  <p n="19">19. After the taking of <hi>Tyrus, Darius</hi> sent Proposals of Peace to <hi>Alexander,</hi> which <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander</hi> did not much mind, but invaded <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea;</hi> the Inhabitants whereof had sworn Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance to <hi>Darius,</hi> and refus'd to surrender to him. At that time the Governour of the <hi>Jews</hi> was one <hi>Jaddus,</hi> whose Brother <hi>Manas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> had marry'd the Daughter of <hi>Sanballat,</hi> Governour of <hi>Samaria,</hi> under <hi>Darius.</hi> This being done contrary to the Laws of the Country, and he refusing to part with his Wife, his Father-in-Law <hi>Sanballat</hi> built a Temple in <hi>Gerizin,</hi> a Mountain in <hi>Samaria,</hi> in which he was to perform the Office of a High-priest.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. <hi>Alexander</hi> was mightily incens'd at the answer sent him by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned destruction to the whole Nation; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Jaddus,</hi> in his Pontificial habit, went out to meet him: As soon as the King saw the Priest, he alighted from his Horse, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship'd him. And when <hi>Permenio</hi> ask'd him the reason of so doing; he answer'd, that he worshipd the God of that Priest, who appear'd to him in such a habit in <hi>Greece,</hi> when he was considering seriously of the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:136207:112"/> War, and encourag'd him to go on in the design'd Expedition. The Prophecy of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> which plainly pointed to him, was laid open before him; whereupon he offer'd Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifie to their God, and freely allow'd the Nation several immunities, and gave liberty to all the <hi>Jews,</hi> that had a mind to be Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, to worship God in their own way. Having taken <hi>Gaza,</hi> where he was wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the shoulder; he master'd all <hi>Palestine,</hi> and from thence march'd into <hi>Egypt,</hi> which came into his hands without stroke of Sword. He built a new City between the Lake <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeotis</hi> and the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Sea, in the same place where the Village <hi>Rhacotis</hi> stood, and christen'd it <hi>Alexandria.</hi> In this work he employ'd <hi>Dinocrates,</hi> or <hi>Stasicrates.</hi> This Town, which afterwards became very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, was founded in the 5th. year of <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander,</hi> the 1st. year of the 112th. Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad, the 417th. of <hi>Nabonasar:</hi> From whence <hi>Ptolomaeus,</hi> the celebrated Mathematician of this City, dates the beginning of the <hi>Aera</hi> of <hi>Alexander,</hi> in the month <hi>Thoth</hi> of the 5th. year of <hi>Darius</hi>'s reign, 329 years before Christ. A. M. 3673.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. <hi>Alexander</hi> went from <hi>Egypt</hi> to the <hi>Hammonian</hi> Oracle, where the Goddess, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thro' Ignorance or the Corruption of the <hi>Greek</hi> Language, saluted him as the Son of <hi>Jupiter.</hi> From thence he took occasion to aspire beyond human things, and require the adoration of a God, and to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose was call'd by the <hi>Arabs, Dulcarnajin.</hi>

In the mean time <hi>Darius</hi> was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for another Battel, and drew together an Army that doubled the number of that which fought at <hi>Issus. Alexander</hi> with all possible speed cross'd the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gris;</hi> and his Expedition in crossing the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, put his Soldiers in such a condition, that <hi>Darius</hi> might easily have routed them. But the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire was now on its last Legs, and the fatal Exit was unavoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. <hi>Statira, Darius</hi>'s Wife, was so fatigu'd with the Journey, that she miscarry'd by the way, and dy'd. Her death made <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander</hi> cry bitterly. This his humanity made such an impression upon <hi>Darius,</hi> that he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd him his Daughter <hi>Statira,</hi> with 30000 Talents, and all <hi>Asia,</hi> lying between the <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lespont</hi> and <hi>Euphrates.</hi>

                  <p n="25">25. But <hi>Alexander</hi> rejected these terms, as being not favourable enough; so that they came to another Engagement upon the River <hi>Bumelus,</hi> near the Village <hi>Gaugamela;</hi> where <hi>Darius</hi> was routed, and put to flight, as easily as before, and lost an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Men; which Authors do not certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agree upon. This Battel was fought the 5th. day of the month <hi>Boedromion,</hi> in the 6th. year of <hi>Alexander,</hi> the 6th. of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> the 2d. of the 112th.

From thence he went to <hi>Susa,</hi> where a large Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure was given him: And from thence to <hi>Persepolis,</hi> which he allow'd the Soldiers to plunder and lay waste; and when he was drunk, yielded to the Solicitations of <hi>Thais,</hi> the Whore, in ordering the Palace to be set on fire, in the execution whereof she had the first hand.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. Then he went to <hi>Pasargadae,</hi> a Town (the name whereof signifies, the Army of the <hi>Persians</hi>) built by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> in memory of the Victory obtain'd over his Grandfather <hi>Astyages.</hi> Here he open'd <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s Tomb, where he found a Golden Bed, a Golden Table and Cups, and a great quantity of Garments adorn'd with Pearls. Then he render'd himself master of all <hi>Persia,</hi> what by force, and what by other methods, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the rising of the <hi>Pleiades,</hi> from whence the Ancients us'd to date the beginning of Summer.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. <hi>Darius,</hi> in order to have the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of renewing the War, at a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable distance, fled towards <hi>Bactria. Bessus,</hi> the Governour of that Country, and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barzanes,</hi> the General of the Horse, bound him with Fetters, and when they heard of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s approach, wounded him mortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. They likewise wounded the Beasts that drew his Coach, and left them to wander
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:136207:113"/> without e'er a Coachman. By chance they came to a place where <hi>Polystratus,</hi> the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonian,</hi> being a'most choak'd with thirst, was come to drink Water in his Helmet.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. He found <hi>Darius</hi> just expiring in his Coach, who desir'd of him a draught of Water. <hi>Polystratus</hi> gave him such as he could find, which was muddy, and polluted with dead Corpses; and <hi>Darius</hi> said he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver drunk with more pleasure in his Life, because he was scarce ever thirsty when he drank. He return'd thanks to <hi>Alexander</hi> for his singular humanity, and wish'd him the Empire of the World. He affirm'd that it was his interest, and that of all other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, not to suffer his death to go unpunish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Then he gave <hi>Polystratus</hi> his hand, with a return of thanks, and expir'd.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. Authors give strange accounts of the Splendor, Luxury and Pleasures of <hi>Darius,</hi> which are rather to be imputed to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the times, than to him: He kept in his Camp all sorts of Cooks, Confecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, and dressers of Meat, and Perfumers, that nothing might be wanting towards his bodily pleasures. As for other things, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Authors have given full accounts of the noble Splendor of the Table and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainments of the <hi>Persian</hi> Kings.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. IN the reign of <hi>Cyrus</hi> the Great, <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> Tyrant of <hi>Samos,</hi> flourish'd; and from a mean Original, advanc'd himself to so happy a State, that none of the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Tyrants cou'd match.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Suidas</hi> derives the name of <hi>Tyrannus</hi> from <hi>Tyrrheni</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> People, famous for their Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and Robberies: Others, from <hi>Tyrus,</hi> a City, that flourish'd in Riches and Glory. At first
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:136207:114"/> the name imply'd no harm; for all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Poets, bating <hi>Homer,</hi> give it to good and worthy Kings. Afterwards the Violence and Cruelty of some, who invaded the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of Affairs, and Usurp'd the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Cities, without any right, gave occasion to the word's being apply'd to an unfavourable meaning: And from the time that it fell under that acceptation, we sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom meet with it as apply'd otherwise.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. However, <hi>Polycrates</hi> having reduc'd the Citizens to a worse state than that of slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, was so very successful, that whatever he did, he came off with the Victory. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded all his Neighbours, without any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, protesting that he would oblige his Friend more in restoring what he took from him, than in taking nothing at all. But <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masis,</hi> the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> with whom he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into a League, affirm'd, that his unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable happiness would terminate in some terrible disaster; and with that view per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded him to give his fortune another turn, by throwing away what was dearest to him.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. He went aboard of a Ship, and threw out a Ring, with a Seal upon it of Emerauld. It happen'd so that the Ring was afterwards found in the belly of a Fish, which for its stately bulk, was given to the King, as a Present. Upon the News of that Accident, <hi>Amasis</hi> renounc'd all Friendship with him, as foreseeing that he would come to a miserable end. And indeed he prov'd no false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</p>

                        <pb n="226" facs="tcp:136207:115"/>5. For <hi>Oraetes,</hi> the <hi>Persian,</hi> Governour of <hi>Sardes,</hi> under <hi>Cambyses,</hi> being well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Man's Temper, offer'd him a large sum of Money, in order to subdue <hi>Greece;</hi> and by that means tempted him to come to <hi>Asia:</hi> And when he had him there, kill'd him; either out of a prospect of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by the Death of the Tyrant, or else with a design to join <hi>Samos</hi> to the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire. After <hi>Polycrates, Maeandrius</hi> was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour to the <hi>Samians;</hi> but he being dispatch'd by the orders of <hi>Darius,</hi> the <hi>Persian, Sylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> Son to <hi>Polycrates,</hi> was made Tyrant; after him, his Son <hi>Aeaces</hi> succeeded, by the assistance of the <hi>Persians,</hi> but was outted in the 18th. year of <hi>Darius,</hi> the Son of <hi>Hystas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes,</hi> when <hi>Aristagoras,</hi> the <hi>Milesian,</hi> broke the Tyrannical Governments of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in order to promote the Rebellion of the <hi>Ionians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. In the 3d. year of the 66th. Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad, and the 8th. year of <hi>Darius,</hi> there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd great Commotions at <hi>Athens,</hi> which forwarded the overthrow of Tyranny. The <hi>Pisistradae</hi> were then Governours of <hi>Athens,</hi> and had hithreto kept themselves within the bounds of moderation; but now it happen'd that <hi>Hipparchus,</hi> the second of that line, fell in Love with one <hi>Harmodius,</hi> and solicited him to <hi>Sodomy;</hi> and was thereupon kill'd by him and his Friend <hi>Aristogiton.</hi> His eldest Son <hi>Hippias,</hi> was so much incens'd by the Action, that tho' the Actors were kill'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the spot, yet he treated the People with more severity. This gave occasion to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:136207:115"/> which, by the help of the <hi>Alcmaeonidae,</hi> procur'd the liberty of the <hi>Athenians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">7. The <hi>Alcmaeonidae</hi> were the Off-spring of <hi>Alcmaeon,</hi> the great Grandson of <hi>Nestor,</hi> who, being turn'd out of <hi>Messenia,</hi> by the <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clidae,</hi> came to <hi>Athens,</hi> and were banish'd from thence by the <hi>Pisistratidae.</hi> They had brib'd the Priestess of <hi>Apollo;</hi> so that when the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> consulted the <hi>Delphick</hi> Oracle, she always an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd that <hi>Athens</hi> wou'd be retriev'd out of the hands of Tyrants. Upon which motion, the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> sent an Army twice to beat them out. At last the Sons of the <hi>Pisistratidae</hi> being taken Prisoners upon the flight, their Fathers ransom'd them with the promise of banishing themselves from <hi>Athens:</hi> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, they went to <hi>Sigaeum,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Lampsacus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. The <hi>Pisistratidae</hi> being thus turn'd out; the <hi>Athenians</hi> split into two Factions, which were headed by <hi>Clysthenes</hi> and <hi>Isagoras.</hi> The former, in order to get the better of his Rival, made it his whole business to ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate himself with the People. He conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the 4 Tribes into 10; he expell'd <hi>Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> with his Party, and restor'd the Laws of <hi>Solon;</hi> and to prevent the Tyranical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions of those who were great in power, introduc'd a Law, injoining a 10 years Exile to all those whom power or glory had rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed beyond the common level. This Law was call'd <hi>Ostracismus,</hi> because the people in their meetings, wrote upon an Oyster shell, the names of the Persons they had a mind to banish.</p>
                     <p n="9">
                        <pb n="228" facs="tcp:136207:116"/>9. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> sided with <hi>Isagoras,</hi> and their Garrison was turn'd out together with him. Their King, <hi>Cleomenes,</hi> taking that for an Affront, march'd once more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Athenians,</hi> but return'd without doing any thing. Soon after, <hi>Darius</hi> having reduc'd the rebel <hi>Ionians,</hi> sent Ambassadors to <hi>Greece,</hi> to demand Subjection. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Aegina</hi> and the other Islands com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd with his demands. <hi>Cleomenes.</hi> the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonian,</hi> came to <hi>Aegina,</hi> to take up the heads of the revolt, but <hi>Demaratus,</hi> his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league, with whom he was at variance, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented his design: Whereupon, he was so incens'd, that he return'd to <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> and got <hi>Demaratus</hi> degraded, and <hi>Leutychides</hi> put in his place.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Both of 'em were punish'd for the injury they did to <hi>Demaratus;</hi> for <hi>Leutychides</hi> was found guilty of Treachery, and dy'd in his Exile: And <hi>Cleomenes</hi> turn'd Lunatick, and rip'd up his flesh, beginning at his feet, and when he came to the guts kill'd himself. The <hi>Athenians</hi> renewed the War with the people of <hi>Aegina:</hi> Upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, that while the <hi>Athenians</hi> detain'd their Hostages, they intercepted a Galley that us'd to sail every year from <hi>Athens</hi> to <hi>Delphi.</hi> But upon <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s invasion of <hi>Greece</hi> they clap'd up a Peace.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. In the time of this War, the Battel between the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Darius</hi>'s Forces, was fought at <hi>Marathon;</hi> in which <hi>Miltiades,</hi> the <hi>Grecian</hi> General, came off with the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory. This <hi>Miltiades</hi> was the Son of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
                        <pb n="229" facs="tcp:136207:116"/> and late Tyrant of <hi>Chersonesus.</hi> He un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook a fruitless Expedition against the <hi>Parii,</hi> upon which he was fin'd in a large sum of Money, and not being able to pay it, dy'd in Prison: Nay, his Corps were kept up till <hi>Cimon</hi> his Son deliver'd himself up as a pledge, who did not get out till the Money was paid.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Soon after <hi>Xerxes</hi> invaded <hi>Greece.</hi> The <hi>Athenians</hi> were the chief Authors of this War, and accordingly sustain'd the greatest burden in it. Their Victory is a'most whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly owing to the sagacity and industry of <hi>Themistocles;</hi> for 'twas he that perswaded the Citizens to build a Fleet, that diverted the <hi>Peloponnesians</hi> from returning home, and put <hi>Xerxes</hi> to flight.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. <hi>Aristides,</hi> who, by reason of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness of his life, was sirnam'd the Just, join'd with <hi>Themistocles.</hi> Formerly indeed <hi>Themistocles</hi> had put him out of the City, by virtue of the <hi>Ostracismus,</hi> but recall'd him when he saw his Country reduc'd to that extremity of danger. After <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s flight, the <hi>Grecians</hi> routed and kill'd <hi>Mardonius,</hi> his General, in the Battel of <hi>Plataea.</hi> While these things were carry'd on against the publick Enemy, there were but few Domestick Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences, that did not relate to them.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. As for their Learned Men: Some of the seven Wise Men flourish'd in the Reign of <hi>Cyrus.</hi> Now these seven were <hi>Pittacus</hi> of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tylene, Bias</hi> of <hi>Priene, Chilon</hi> of <hi>Lacedemon, Cleobulus</hi> of <hi>Lindus, Thales</hi> of <hi>Miletus, Solon</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> and <hi>Periander,</hi> a Tyrant of <hi>Corinth.</hi>

                        <pb n="230" facs="tcp:136207:117"/>15. About the same time flourish'd <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes</hi> of <hi>Colophon; Phocylides; Anacreon,</hi> a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et; <hi>Anaximander,</hi> a Physician of <hi>Miletus; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naximenes</hi> his Disciple; <hi>Theagenes</hi> of <hi>Rhegium,</hi> a most ancient Chronologer; <hi>Democedes</hi> of <hi>Croton,</hi> a Physitian, who was taken prisoner by <hi>Darius,</hi> and administred Physick to him and his Wife <hi>Atossa,</hi> with very good success.</p>

                     <p n="11">11.

                     <p n="12">12. With their assistance, the <hi>Corcyreans</hi> defeated the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> in a Sea Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

However, a Peace was struck for five years; chiefly upon these terms, that all Places and Prisoners taken on either side should be given up, excepting a few Cities. But several Cities complained of the injustice of this Peace, and instead of continuing their hatred against the <hi>Athenians,</hi> their known Enemies, transfered it upon the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> as being guilty of flaming Injustice.

The <hi>Athenians</hi> charg'd 'em with many failures upon this score, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely refus'd to give up <hi>Pylus.</hi> But the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were eager to have it; and in order to the obtaining of it got <hi>Panactum</hi> from the <hi>Boeotians</hi> to be deliver'd to the <hi>the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> but upon these terms, that the Town should be dismantled, and that the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> should enter into an Alliance with the <hi>Boeotians.</hi> So that the <hi>Athenians</hi> whom they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:136207:123"/> so much to oblige, had two reasons to be angry with 'em, first for dismantling the Town, and then for making a League with the <hi>Boeotians,</hi> which was directly contrary to the Rules of a close Alliance.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. While the angry <hi>Athenians</hi> continued in suspence, whether they should think of Peace or War; <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> a youth of a noble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent, and <hi>Pericles</hi>'s Sister's Son, push'd 'em on to War: And the <hi>Ephori</hi> themselves were so far against Peace, that all proposals of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation were rejected. So that the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi> enter'd into a Confederacy with the <hi>Argives</hi> and some other <hi>Peloponnesians,</hi> and imployed <hi>Alcibiades</hi> to make a descent into the <hi>Peloponnesus.</hi> Next Summer, the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> sent their King <hi>Agis</hi> to maul the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gives;</hi> and afterwards check'd him severely for his ill success: But he having obtain'd his pardon for once, march'd against 'em a second time, and retriev'd his fame, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feating them in a Bloody and most noble Battle, as <hi>Thucidydes</hi> calls it.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Notwithstanding this Victory, the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> still courted the Alliance of the <hi>Argives;</hi> and indeed a League was brought about by the Ministry of their chief Noblemen, who were for an <hi>Oligarchy.</hi> But soon after, the people geting the upper-hand, look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as illegal; and renew'd an Alliance with the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who were under the same Republican Government. Hitherto the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> thought themselves at so low an Ebb, that, tho the <hi>Athenians</hi> attack'd <hi>Melus</hi> their Colony (which they afterwards master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:136207:123"/> and us'd very cruelly) and made Incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions from <hi>Pylus</hi> into <hi>Laconia;</hi> yet they did not complain of the violation of the Treaty; but only allow'd their Subjects to plunder the <hi>Athenians.</hi> And these were the transactions of the Summer of the tenth year.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. But in the fourth year of this War; the <hi>Athenians,</hi> tho at the same time otherwise ingag'd, had fitted out a Fleet for <hi>Sicily;</hi> and gave it out, as if they had design'd to assist the <hi>Leontinae</hi> against the <hi>Syracusans;</hi> but the real project was to make themselves Masters of that Isle, by vertue of which they might gall <hi>Greece</hi> more sensibly. They continued now and then to send Forces thither, and foment their Divisions: Whereupon <hi>Hermocrates</hi> the <hi>Syracusan</hi> perswaded 'em to lay aside all their animosities, and joyn unanimously in a vigorous opposition to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on a design against their Liberties.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. But all <hi>Hermocrates</hi>'s Remonstrances, could not keep the Citizens of <hi>Egesta</hi> from falling by the ears with those of <hi>Selinus,</hi> whom the <hi>Syracusans</hi> sided with. <hi>Egesta</hi> had enter'd into a Confederacy with the <hi>Athenians,</hi> and desir'd Auxiliary Troops from them, offering to pay themselves. The <hi>Athenians,</hi> who were fond of any opportunity of enlarging their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, sent some Deputies to <hi>Egesta,</hi> to enquire into the Riches and Splendor of the City. The Deputies return'd and magnified their Riches beyond their due extent: Whereupon the people resolv'd to send 'em Auxiliary Troops under the conduct of <hi>Nicias, Alcibiades,</hi> and <hi>Lamachus.</hi> And great preparations were made for War.</p>
                     <p n="14">
                        <pb n="244" facs="tcp:136207:124"/>14. When the Fleet was just ready to put off, the Statues of <hi>Hermes</hi> or <hi>Mercurius,</hi> which stood at the Citizens Gates, were maim'd in the night-time of their Arms. This mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incens'd the people, and inflam'd their sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> who was a Man of an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring temper, and seem'd to dislike the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Government. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> dreaded that his Enemies would get him condemn'd in absence; and therefore desir'd a Tryal before his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But those who knew his interest with the Soldiers, had no mind to start the quarrel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he set out. But as soon as the Fleet came upon the <hi>Sicilian</hi> coast, he was recall'd, and fled to <hi>Lacedemon;</hi> whereupon he was condemn'd, and some of his friends were put to death.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. In the mean time the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> and <hi>Corinthians</hi> assisted <hi>Selinus</hi> and <hi>Syracusa;</hi> and <hi>Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippus</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> prov'd a great obstacle to the projects of <hi>Nicias. Nicias</hi> indeed was not wanting in serving his <hi>Country;</hi> but being blam'd by <hi>Demosthenes</hi> for not attacking <hi>Syracusa,</hi> which was the Bullwark of the War; was influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by his authority to attack <hi>Epipolae,</hi> a very inaccessible place; and when had done his utmost, whas oblig'd to retire with loss.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> being cast down by this disaster, had a mind to be gone. But <hi>Nicias,</hi> knowing the humor of the People, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways measure things by the event, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to put his Life and Fortune in so much danger. But afterwards upon the news that <hi>Gylippus</hi> advanced with fresh Troops, he chang'd his mind, and was just making ready to get off when the Moon happen'd to be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipsed.
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:136207:124"/> Then <hi>Nicias</hi> was so sway'd by su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, that he would not stir till the 27 day. Upon the glad news of their delay, the <hi>Syracusans</hi> resolv'd to cut off their retreat, or at least to oblige 'em to take another way. First of all, they attack'd their Camp, and the next day forced 'em to an Engagement both by Sea and Land. And <hi>Eurymedon, Nicias</hi>'s Collegue, died in a very sharp Engagement, in the mouth of the Harbour.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. The <hi>Syracusans</hi> having resolved to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the mouth of the Harbour with a wall, in order to prevent the retreat of their Enemies; the <hi>Athenians</hi> resolv'd upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sea Engagement, and in case it prov'd unfortunate, design'd to burn their Ships and march off by Land. In pursuance of this reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution they endeavour'd to joyn their Camp to their Fleet; but the <hi>Syracusans</hi> oppos'd the enterprise so vigorously, that the two Navy's fell in with one another, and there followed such an Engagement as was never heard of. After the Engagement, the Land Forces refus'd▪ to board the Ships; and therefore there was a necessity of pushing on a Land Fight. Had they gone immediately off, they had done better; but <hi>Hermonates</hi> the <hi>Syracusan</hi> manag'd 'em so dexterously, that they linger'd till the third day.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. Their flight presented the world with a memorable spectacle, of Howlings, Sorrow, Misery, and the uncertainty of Humane Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. <hi>Gylippus</hi> took 130 of their Ships in that Harbour; and oblig'd the rest to strike, who had fled, and divided themselves into
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:136207:125"/> two Squadrons. In one day 18000 of 'em were kill'd, and 700 taken and condemn'd to the Mines, who were afterwards sold. <hi>Nicias</hi> and <hi>Demosthenes</hi> either died in Prison, or laid violent hands on themselves. And this was the upshot of the Ambition of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who, by grasping at all, were mortified with the loss of almost every thing.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. The more the <hi>Athenians</hi> were morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in seeing themselves baulk'd, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was the Joy and Congratulation of the other <hi>Grecians:</hi> Such of 'em as wag'd War with the <hi>Athenians,</hi> seem'd to Triumph o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their most Cruel and Haughty Enemies; and such as serv'd under them were glad to be rid of the yoke of Bondage. <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> then in Exile, was busie in projecting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Country; but soon after he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came suspected to the <hi>Peloponnesians,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis,</hi> the King, whose Wife he had debauch'd, gave orders to <hi>Astyochus,</hi> his General, to kill him. Whereupon he fled to <hi>Tissaphernes,</hi> whom he alienated from the <hi>Peloponnesians,</hi> by suggesting such things to the Governour as made well for the King.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. For he open'd to him the whole case of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and perswaded him to change the Soldiers pay from a <hi>Drachma</hi> to three <hi>Obuli;</hi> and told him he ought to stop even a part of that, in order to make the Soldiers more obedient, upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of having their full pay. He told him, that he ought by all means to take care that the <hi>Athenians</hi> were not quite undone by the <hi>Lacedemonians;</hi> that 'twas his interest to keep
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:136207:125"/> these two Cities upon a Balance, in order to waste one another; that he ought rather to have most regard for the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who contented themselves with being masters of the Sea, without extending their Conquests further; whereas, the Ambition of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians</hi> was boundless, insomuch, that they made account to free all the <hi>Grecians</hi> from the <hi>Persian</hi> yoke.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. <hi>Tissaphernes</hi> look'd upon these suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as the Dictates of an Oracle, and took all his measures accordingly: So that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver perform'd his promise of joining his Fleet with that of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and cut the sinews of their Forces by stopping their pay. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> thought of nothing now but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to his own Country, and wrote some Letters to that effect; but insinuated that he would not willingly return, unless the Popular Government, under which he was banish'd, were abolish'd.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. The Nobility indeed got this done for him; but matters were not yet ripe, by reason that <hi>Tissaphernes</hi> did not continue his Friend. The <hi>Athenian</hi> Army was then at <hi>Samos,</hi> and were mightily displeas'd with the change of the form of Government: Whereupon he made his address to them, and they recall'd him. Now the heats be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Army and the 400 <hi>Oligarchical</hi> Men who had the Administration of Affairs in their hands, came to that heighth, that the <hi>Athenians</hi> were again beaten at Sea, and would certainly have been quite undone, had they been engag'd with any other E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:136207:126"/> besides the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> who were always lazy and backward for action.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. Upon this disaster they endeavour'd to make Friends with the Army; and, to that end, transfer'd the Government from 400 Men to 5000, and enacted such Laws, that <hi>Thucydides</hi> says, the Republick of the <hi>Athenians</hi> was then in its best Constitution, as being equally remov'd from the Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a few, and the boundless Liberty of a multitude. Affairs being thus put in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they began to chear up, and entertain bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hopes. In the mean time <hi>Alcibiades</hi> went to visit <hi>Tissaphernes,</hi> and was detain'd Prisoner by him, who mean'd by so doing to oblige the King, who, he fear'd, might be wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the querulous requests of the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="24">24. However, <hi>Alcibiades</hi> escap'd out of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and advancing to <hi>Cyzicum,</hi> defeated <hi>Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darus,</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> General, both by Sea and Land; and took all the <hi>Peloponne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> Ships, insomuch that Letters were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted, as directed for <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> which gave this <hi>Laconick</hi> account of their case. <hi>All's gone;</hi> Mindarus <hi>is lost: The Soldiers are star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for hunger. We cannot tell what to do.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="25">25. Upon this turn of Affairs, the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians</hi> sent Ambassadors to <hi>Athens,</hi> with proposals of Peace. But <hi>Cleophon</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded the <hi>Athenians</hi> not to give them any Audience: So necessary was the Fate that awaited the <hi>Athenians.</hi> For a short time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed things went pretty even with 'em, and when <hi>Alcibiades</hi> return'd, they treated
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:136207:126"/> him very honourably, and made him their General. But soon after, such was the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity of the Mob, that they degraded him because the Admiral of the Fleet had fought unfortunately in his absence, and nominated ten Generals for the Land and Naval Force. These ten defeated <hi>Callicratides,</hi> the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian, Lysander</hi>'s successor, in a Sea Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but by reason that some of the Ships were run down, and some of the Soldiers so lost, instead of being invested with the honours they merited, were sentenc'd to die; and six of 'em, of whom <hi>Pericles,</hi> the Son of <hi>Pericles,</hi> was one, were beheaded.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. Then the <hi>Peloponnesians</hi> perceiv'd their Affairs were in a staggering condition, and therefore resolved to take other measures, and to make <hi>Lysander</hi> Admiral. By the Laws of the Country <hi>Lysander</hi> could not be twice Admiral: But, in order to elude them, he was employ'd as Vice-Admiral under one <hi>Aracus. Lysander</hi> fell in with the <hi>Athenian</hi> Fleet in the River <hi>Aegospotamus,</hi> which lay there securely, and out of order, and of 130 Ships took 'em all, bating 8, and of 3000 Soldiers they were all kill'd, bating one <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimantus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="27">27. <hi>Lysander</hi> clear'd all the Cities of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Garrisons, which he sent home to <hi>Athens,</hi> to the end, that the City being crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with People, might be uncapable to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure a long siege. He dissolv'd the Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical Government, and introduc'd Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garchy every where, insomuch that he got his own Friends to be invested with Power
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:136207:127"/> in all the Cities, and by that means obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a sort of tyranny over <hi>Greece.</hi> At last he fetch'd his Forces from <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> and inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted <hi>Athens</hi> by Sea and Land, which, after standing out to the last extremity, surrender'd upon these terms.</p>
                     <p n="28">28. <hi>The Fortifications of the Haven, and the long Walls, were to be demolish'd; all their Ships, bating</hi> 12, <hi>to be given up; their banish'd persons to be received; the</hi> Athenians <hi>were to stand and fall with the</hi> Lacedemonians, <hi>and make Peace and War as they did. Lysander</hi> possess'd himself of the Ships and Walls on the 16th day of the month <hi>Munichion:</hi> The Ships he set on fire; and the Walls were levell'd to the Ground with sound of Trumpet. Thus the 27th year, and the War it self, which took off more <hi>Grecian</hi> Captains, than almost all the preceding Wars, came to an end, in the 78th year after the <hi>Trojan</hi> War, the 4th year of the 93d Olympiad, the 19th of <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> A. M. 3600.</p>

THE next year, in which the 94th <hi>Olympiad</hi> was celebrated, <hi>Crocina,</hi> the <hi>Thessalian</hi> being Victor, when <hi>Endicus</hi> was <hi>Ephorus,</hi> and <hi>Pythodorus</hi> Archon at <hi>Athens,</hi> 30 Men were chosen to make Laws, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the Affairs of the Republick. These 30 Men having got the Power into their hands, by the assistance of <hi>Lysander,</hi> thought of nothing, but establishing their own power, and introduced a more monstrous and insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable Tyranny than was ever heard of else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. Blood and rapine shined through e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>every part of it: Citizens were pitch'd upon whose Estates would be a goodly spoil after they were murdered: And <hi>Theramenes</hi> their Colleague was sentenc'd to drink a draught of Hemlock, by a judgment which was so much the more injust, because it was publick. His Crime was, that he hated their monstrous wickedness, and made it his business to stop the mischievous effects of the same.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="252" facs="tcp:136207:128"/>2. A great part of the Citizens went off and banish'd themselves; and their Estates were declar'd to be forfeited to the Tyrants Exchequer. Among those Citizens, there was one <hi>Thrasybulus,</hi> who at the head of 30 Men first possess'd himself of <hi>Phyle</hi> a Castle in <hi>Attica;</hi> and afterwards being fortified by the number of Men that fled thither, master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Haven; whereupon those who remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the City, wrested the Govenment out of the hands of the Tyrants. The Tyrants sought assistance from the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> whereupon <hi>Lysander</hi> came presently, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieg'd the <hi>Pyraeum.</hi> But his treatment of the banish'd persons was so hard, that <hi>Pausanias</hi> the King, who envy'd him the glory of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering <hi>Athens</hi> a second time, render'd all his attempts ineffectual. So that <hi>Pausanias</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored <hi>Athens</hi> to its former condition; he banish'd the Tyrants and put the Government into the hands of the people, and a general indemnity was concluded upon by universal consent; which according to <hi>Xenophon</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, was the great and the only bond of Peace and concord, and was admirably well calculated for those times.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. This was the exit of the Tyranny of the 30 Men: Who, as one says, being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to sit at the Helm of Affairs by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates Decree, put 1400 Citizens to Death, and banished more than 5000. Neither did their fury confine it self to the Town, but reach'd ev'n to <hi>Asia,</hi> and brought destruction to <hi>Alcibiades</hi> the hope of his Country: For they fear'd that one day he might come and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:136207:128"/> rescue <hi>Athens,</hi> and could promise themselves no security while he liv'd; and with that view intreated the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> by any means to take him out of the way. The <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> oblig'd <hi>Pharnabazus</hi> to perpetrate the murder, either because they dreaded him as well as the Tyrants, or out of a design to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige King <hi>Agis,</hi> whose Wife he had kiss'd. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> died in the flower of his age, when he had not seen above 40 years. He was a Man of a wonderful genius, and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to the last degree. <hi>Socrates</hi> lov'd him with a true Platonical Love; but it seems it produc'd no great effects, since it is apparent that <hi>Alcibiades</hi> was equally superiour to all Men, both in Vice and Vertue. <hi>Cyrus</hi> the lesser being kill'd in the Battel at <hi>Cunaza,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plor'd the assistance of the <hi>Lacedemonians.</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Tissaphernes.</hi> Accordingly they sent <hi>Thimbrones</hi> into <hi>Asia;</hi> and when they heard that a great Fleet was fitting out in <hi>Phoenicia, Agesilaus</hi> their King went himself upon the Expedition. This <hi>Agesilaus</hi> was the Brother of <hi>Agis,</hi> that died but lately; he was lame of one Leg, and worsted <hi>Leotychidas</hi> in a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute upon the right of Succession, by <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sander</hi>'s assistance. 'Twas shrewdly suspected that this <hi>Leotcyhidas</hi> was not the genuine Son of <hi>Agis,</hi> but was begot by <hi>Alcibiades.</hi> As soon as <hi>Agesilaus</hi> arriv'd in <hi>Asia,</hi> he found that <hi>Lysanders</hi> dignity, and the glory of his memorable actions obscur'd him: Upon which account he always was against his motions, in order to eclipse his interest, and remov'd him to the administration of other things at a
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:136207:129"/> great distance. However he carried every thing before him, so that he seem'd to stand fair for the Empire of the East; when the <hi>Persians</hi> finding there was a necessity of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him out of <hi>Asia,</hi> or else they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, brib'd the <hi>Grecian</hi> Cities with Gold, to declare War against the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> in order to constrain him to return to the relief of his Country.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The <hi>Thebans</hi> were the first, that attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and <hi>Pausanias</hi> the King and <hi>Lysander</hi> were sent to make head against them. <hi>Lysander</hi> first brought off <hi>Orchomenum</hi> from their Confederacy with the <hi>Thebans,</hi> and afterwards died in the Siege of <hi>Haliartum.</hi> He was a cruel and cunning fellow, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways promoted his own designs right or wrong, and us'd to say that when the Cast-Coats of <hi>A Lion</hi> would not serve, the skin of a Fox should be patch'd upon 'em. But <hi>Pausanias</hi> was condemned for not sending him relief according to his promise, and for several other Crimes, with which he was charged; whereupon he fled to <hi>Tegea,</hi> where he sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and died. However the <hi>Ephori,</hi> and <hi>Aristodemus</hi> Guardian to King <hi>Agesipolis,</hi> drew together 15000 Men, and routed the Confederate Army, consisting of 20000, with the loss only of 8 Men.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Agesilaus</hi> return'd to <hi>Greece,</hi> and routed the Confederates, in the bloody Battel at <hi>Chaeronea,</hi> where the <hi>Beotians, Athenians, Argivans, Corinthians, Eubeans, Aenians,</hi> and both the <hi>Locrians,</hi> were engag'd. He manag'd the <hi>Argives</hi> very successfully: But <hi>Conon</hi> the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:136207:129"/>
                        <hi>Athenian,</hi> who promoted the interest of his Country in many things by the assistance of the <hi>Persians,</hi> joyned with <hi>Pharnabazus,</hi> and those two joyntly routed the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> in a Sea-fight; and it seemed as if <hi>Conon</hi> would have pursu'd his Victory further, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> thought it fit to propose a Peace, which after several interviews was at length obtain'd. This Peace was the the first concluded upon between the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians, Athenians, &amp;c.</hi> after the <hi>Peloponne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> War, and was called by the name of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talcidas</hi> the Ambassador that concerted it. But in effect it ought rather to be call'd a betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Grecian Cities, since 'twas upon the pretence of asserting their liberty that <hi>Agesilaus</hi> invaded <hi>Asia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">8. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> having thus obtain'd Peace, became very proud, and pretended to call some of their Neighbours to account, for favouring their Enemies. They oblig'd the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Mantinea</hi> to throw down the Walls of their City, and retire to their Villages, and constrain'd the <hi>Phliasii</hi> to recall their own banish'd persons. They declar'd War against the <hi>Olynthians,</hi> being induc'd so to do by the complaints of the inhabitants of <hi>Acanthus</hi> and <hi>Apolloniatis,</hi> who arraign'd them of a Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy with the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Thebans.</hi> At this time the <hi>Olynthians</hi> were justly much redoubted, for they had mastered a great part of <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and possess'd themselves of <hi>Pella</hi> the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan: And upon the same pretence that the <hi>Laeedemonians</hi> had formerly made use of, of rescuing the Grecian Cities, had outed
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:136207:130"/> King <hi>Amyntas</hi> of almost his whole Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Eudamidas</hi> was sent into <hi>Thrace</hi> with 2000 Men to make head against 'em. He took <hi>Potidaea,</hi> and indeed did enough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering his force. <hi>Thebidas</hi> his Brother was sent after him with an Army, who upon his Journey turn'd off to <hi>Thebes,</hi> the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> being then Seditious, and possess'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of the Castle of <hi>Cadmaea,</hi> which <hi>Leontidas Polemarchus</hi> betray'd into his hands. The Confederates did not approve of this exploit; but finding that <hi>Agesilaus</hi> was an inveterat E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to the <hi>Thebans,</hi> and countenanc'd the Action, and being afraid to thwart the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians,</hi> sent Ambassadors of their own, who together with the three <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> ones, charg'd <hi>Ismenias</hi> Colleague to <hi>Leontidas,</hi> with a Conspiracy with the King of <hi>Persia,</hi> and sentenc'd him to death, and gave the Government of the City to <hi>Leontidas</hi> and his Complices.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> took <hi>Olynthus,</hi> and subdu'd the <hi>Phliasii,</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>Agesilaus.</hi> But at the same time that every thing seem'd to go according to their wishes, all of a sudden the banish'd Persons recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Thebes:</hi> And by a Stratagem of their's, <hi>Sphodrias,</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> was induc'd to invade <hi>Attica;</hi> and <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> upon the sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation of his Son <hi>Archidamus,</hi> countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the invasion: Whereupon the project of the banish'd <hi>Thebans</hi> took effect, that is, the <hi>Athenians</hi> were so incens'd, that they join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in with the <hi>Thebans,</hi> and carried the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:136207:130"/> by Sea oftener than once. <hi>Agesilaus</hi> march'd twice against the <hi>Baeotians,</hi> but came off with the loss, as well as several others after him. By this means the <hi>Thebans</hi> were encourag'd, and being daily exercis'd in War, instead of defending themselves, began to aspire at the Empire of <hi>Greece;</hi> Fortune it self having led the way to them, and drove them upon that project.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. In the next year, which was the 2 of the 101 Olympiad, and the 30 of the Reign of <hi>Artaxerxes Mnemon,</hi> in the Archon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of <hi>Hippodamus; Artaxerxes</hi> saw it his interest to have assistance from the <hi>Grecians</hi> against the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and with that view got 'em to make Peace one with another. But the <hi>Thebans,</hi> who were puff'd up by prosperity, refus'd to stand to the Peace, or to set the <hi>Baeotian</hi> Cities at liberty. They were animated by the Warlick genius of their Citizens, especially <hi>Pelopidas</hi> and, <hi>Epaminondas</hi> who from a poor Philosopher, rose to be the famousest of all the <hi>Grecian</hi> Generals.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. And even those who desir'd the Peace, could not enjoy it or confine themselves to its prescriptions; for those who set up for <hi>Democracy,</hi> after they got clear of the <hi>Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonian</hi> yoak, were inveterate Enemies to the <hi>Oligarchy-men,</hi> and bloody Murders were reciprocally committed, while sometimes these and sometimes the People had the upper-hand: Neither did these <hi>Grecian</hi> feuds come to an end till they were reduc'd under one Empire.</p>
                     <p n="13">
                        <pb n="258" facs="tcp:136207:131"/>13. However, the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> always stood by <hi>Oligarchy,</hi> and the <hi>Atheniaas</hi> by the Popular Government: So that the Peace was presently trampled upon, and both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties took up Arms. The <hi>Thebans</hi> observing that the other two were chiefly at variance, minded their game very close, and posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed themselves of <hi>Plataea</hi> and <hi>Thespia,</hi> because they seem'd to favour the <hi>Athenians;</hi> which Cities they levell'd with the ground, at the same time that <hi>Helice</hi> and <hi>Bura,</hi> two <hi>Acha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian</hi> Cities, perish'd by an Earth-quake, and a subsequent irruption of the Sea.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. The next year being the first of the 102 Olympiad, in which <hi>Damon,</hi> was Victor, and <hi>Alcisthenes</hi> was Archon, <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes</hi> got the Cities once more to make Peace one with another. But the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans</hi> going upon the same motives as above, would not stand to it. Whereupon the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> declar'd War against them, as the common Enemies of <hi>Greece,</hi> and were fortified by Auxiliary Troops from all the rest, insomuch that <hi>Thebes</hi> seem'd to be in a desperate condition.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. But the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were not aware they had to do with <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> the <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> General, who routed and kill'd <hi>Cleom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brotus</hi> their King, at <hi>Leuctra,</hi> after he had invaded <hi>Boeotia,</hi> and upon the arrival of new Auxiliaries, violated a Truce. In that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement there were 4000 Confederates and 3000 <hi>Thebans</hi> slain. This Battel happen'd in the 34 year after the <hi>Peloponnesian</hi> War, the 2 of the 102 Olympiad, 34 the of <hi>Artaxerxes
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:136207:131"/> Mnemon,</hi> in the Archonship of <hi>Phrasiclis,</hi> A. M. 3634.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. Upon the News of this defeat, the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians</hi> behav'd themselves with a great deal of Constancy, and sent <hi>Archidamus,</hi> their King, to invade <hi>Boeotia</hi> once more; but as soon as he arrived there, a Truce was agreed to by <hi>Jason,</hi> the <hi>Thessalian.</hi> After the Victory at <hi>Leuctria, Epaminondas</hi> had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded all the <hi>Arcadians</hi> to Incorporate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one City, which was called <hi>Magalopolis.</hi> He likewise sent Messengers to <hi>Sicily, Italy,</hi> and the <hi>Euesperian</hi> Islands, and to all other Countries, in which the <hi>Messenians</hi> were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd, to recall them to the Seat of their Grandsires, which then retriev'd its ancient name <hi>Messene.</hi> This restoration of the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senians</hi> happen'd in the 228 year after the taking of <hi>Ira,</hi> the 3 of the 102 Olympiad, while <hi>Dyscinetus</hi> was Archon; during the whole Interval of their absence they retain'd their own Rights and the Dorick Dialect. This is <hi>Pausanias</hi>'s account of the matter, but <hi>Diodorus</hi> would have <hi>Megalopolis</hi> to be built two years later.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. The <hi>Arcadians</hi> being invaded by the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> sought help from the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> in vain, but obtain'd it of the <hi>Thebans. Epaminondas</hi> invaded <hi>Laconia,</hi> and restor'd <hi>Messene</hi> to its Primitive Splendour, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had been 85 days out, was attack'd upon his return, by <hi>Iphicrates</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> whom he defeated and pursu'd to the Walls of the City. But, after all, he return'd too late, because the Laws provided that new
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:136207:132"/> Captains should be chosen in the beginning of the month <hi>Bucatium,</hi> and was thereupon brought to a Tryal.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. He pleaded that he was not at all unwilling to die, providing they would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave upon his Tomb the great and Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Actions he had done. But the People were so much taken with the recital of his Atchievements, that they freely clear'd him. Soon after he return'd to <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> and, after the doing of many good services to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, and the taking of several Cities, attack'd <hi>Corinth,</hi> but, being repuls'd by <hi>Chabrias,</hi> return'd to <hi>Thebes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="19">19. The <hi>Arcadians</hi> thinking it unworthy of them to be retainers in the War, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew themselves from their Alliance, and made friends with the <hi>Athenians.</hi> The <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satae</hi> wag'd War with the <hi>Eleans;</hi> and claim'd a right to the Administration of the Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick Games, by virtue of some fabulous pleas. And indeed they Administred at the Celebration of the 104 Olympiad, which is therefore left out in the Catalogue of the Olympiads in the <hi>Elean</hi> Annals; and it is not certain who was then Victor. However, the <hi>Arcadians</hi> being possess'd of the Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick Temple, converted the Money they found there to the use of their Soldiers.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. The <hi>Mantineans</hi> protested loudly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this sacriledge, and the quarrel rose so high, that the <hi>Thebans</hi> were call'd in to prevent the fears of <hi>Arcadia</hi>'s falling whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> hands. <hi>Epaminon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> was once more imploy'd to check the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:136207:132"/> but the <hi>Arcadians</hi> (both <hi>Mantineans</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) smelling that the <hi>Thebans</hi> had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to subdue the <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> made their address to the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> and implor'd their friendship and assistance. <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> upon the news that <hi>Agesilaus</hi> with the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Forces was come up to assist the <hi>Arcadians,</hi> marched directly to <hi>Sparta,</hi> which was then empty and exposed, and which he had certainly carried, had not the divine Providence, as <hi>Xenophon</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erves, stood in the way: For some-body or other had acquainted the King with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, whereupon he sent speedy notice to the Citizens of the approaching danger, with promises of speedy assistance from him.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. When <hi>Epaminondas</hi> found that his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign was render d ineffectual, by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> and <hi>Arcadian</hi> Troops; and that <hi>Mantinea</hi> was left defence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, he returned with all possible expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to possess himself of it. But <hi>Hegelochus</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> at the head of 6000 men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented his design. But after all <hi>Epaminondas</hi> thought he could not handsomely return without an Engagement, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to wait the return of all the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. He march'd towards <hi>Tegea,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving drawn up his Army <hi>Wedge-wise,</hi> surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Enemy, and slew great numbers; but pursuing the fight too eagerly and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely, received a Wound in his Breast,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:136207:133"/> and was carried back to the Camp with the Dart sticking in the wound: where, as soon as he found that his Shield was intire, and that his Men had carried the Victory, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Dart to be taken out of his body, and immediately expired. This was the Exit of one that performed all the offices of a Man and a Philosopher, and of a General: The glory and credit of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Boeotia,</hi> and the ornament of their Schools and Military-arts.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. The Character of <hi>Epaminondas</hi> will sufficiently appear, if we consider that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his time the <hi>Thebans</hi> never did a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable action, and after his day they were toss'd from one rub to another, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made shipwrack of their whole fortune. However the issue of this War was, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side was Victor, tho both of 'em made a shew of the Victory by erecting of Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies; and, as <hi>Xenophon</hi> says, the divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ordered things much otherwise than Men expected. For by the intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> a mutual League was concluded upon by all <hi>Greece,</hi> notwithstanding the remonstrances of <hi>Agesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> in order to exclude the <hi>Messenians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="24">24. The glory of <hi>Agesilaus</hi> seem'd to be much eclips'd by this, that when he was eager for War, he suffer'd <hi>Greece</hi> to be torn in Pieces; and when he was worn out with age served <hi>Nectanebus</hi> the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Tyrant for Money. But he preferr'd the safety of his Country to every thing, and after he
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:136207:133"/> had sacrific'd his honour to his avarice in serving the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> he died upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, in the 84 year of his age, and 41 of his reign, the next year after the death of <hi>Epaminondas,</hi> being that in which <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> died. He was a very great Man, and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to none for military and peaceable Virtues.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. In this interval of time there flourish'd <hi>Hippocrates</hi> of <hi>Coos,</hi> the Prince of Physicians, <hi>Democritus</hi> of <hi>Abdera</hi> the Philosopher, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> the <hi>Athenian, Plato, Sophocles</hi> and <hi>Euri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides</hi> two Poets, <hi>Ctesias</hi> the Physician and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian, <hi>Aristotle</hi> of <hi>Staria</hi> the head of the Peripateticks, <hi>Demosthenes</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator, <hi>Eudoxus</hi> of <hi>Cnidos</hi> the Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, <hi>Zeno</hi> of <hi>Citium</hi> the head of the Stoicks, <hi>Thucydides</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> Historian, and <hi>Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,</hi> who for his Eloquence was call'd <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa attica,</hi> an excellent Philosopher, and a Man so admirably well vers'd in military af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, that his bringing back the Grecians af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of <hi>Cyrus</hi> the lesser, seems just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to surpass all the Atchievements of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the Great, if not in the importance of the thing, at least in the variety of Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems and Conduct.</p>

They refus'd to give up what was freely gifted them, and tho

                     <p n="5">5. When he thought he had sufficiently confirm'd himself in the Government, he subdued the <hi>Poeonians,</hi> conquer'd the <hi>Illyrians,</hi> took <hi>Amphipolis,</hi> and after he had possessed himself of <hi>Potidaea</hi> gifted <hi>Pydna</hi> to the <hi>Olyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> in order to procure their friendship, which he thought would be useful to him. He Christen'd <hi>Crenides</hi> which was mightily enlarged by the accession of new Citizens, by the name of <hi>Philippi,</hi> and improv'd the Gold-mines of that place to that degree, that they fetch'd a 1000 Talents every year; upon which fond he began to be very great. For he coin'd this Gold into pieces which from him were call'd <hi>Philippica,</hi> and hir'd a great number of Troops, and brib'd most of the
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:136207:135"/>
                        <hi>Grecians</hi> to betray their Country. In the mean time his affairs went on the better, that the <hi>Athenians</hi> were engag'd in a Social War, so that they could not mind <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi> and the other affairs of <hi>Greece.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. This <hi>sociable</hi> War took its rise from the revolt of the people of <hi>Chios, Rhodes, Coos</hi> and <hi>Byzantium</hi> from the <hi>Athenians.</hi> It lasted for three years, and then was put to an end, by reason that the <hi>Athenians</hi> fear'd the <hi>Persians</hi> would joyn in with the Rebels. The famous Men in this War were <hi>Jph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, Chabrias,</hi> and <hi>Timotheus,</hi> with whom the glory of all the <hi>Grecian</hi> Generals was sunk and buried.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. In the preceeding year <hi>Philip</hi> had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>Olympias</hi> Daughter of <hi>Neoptolemus</hi> King of the <hi>Molossi,</hi> and Grandaughter (not Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster as <hi>Plutarch</hi> would have it) to <hi>Arymbas</hi> or <hi>Aribbas.</hi> The Kings of the <hi>Thracians, Illyrians</hi> and <hi>Poeonians,</hi> look'd upon his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess with an envious eye, and attempted to do with joint force, what they could not compass separately. But <hi>Philip</hi> attack'd them when they were running up and down in disorder, and easily reduced them to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The same year being the first of the 106 <hi>Olympiad,</hi> the 6th of <hi>Artaxerxes Ochus,</hi> in the Archonship of <hi>Elpinices, Alexander</hi> the Son of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Olympias,</hi> was born at <hi>Pella,</hi> in the Month <hi>Boedromion,</hi> for he was 32 years old and 8 months when he died on the last day of the month <hi>Thargelion,</hi> save one. On
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:136207:136"/> the very day of his birth, the Temple of <hi>Diana</hi> at <hi>Ephesus</hi> was set on fire by some sorry little fellow, that design'd to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his memory to Posterity, by the hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nousness of the action. But it was enacted in the <hi>Pannonian</hi> or Publick Council of <hi>Asia,</hi> that none should make mention of his name, so that it is not certain who it was; some calling him <hi>Herostratus</hi> and others <hi>Lygdamis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9. The next year, <hi>Callistratus</hi> being Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chon, the Phocian or sacred War broke out. The Amphictyones had fin'd the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> for seising upon <hi>Cadmea</hi> without any colour of right; and likewise amerc'd the <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> in a 1000 Talents, for possessing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elves of <hi>Cirrhaea,</hi> a piece of ground that belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Delphick Temple. But <hi>Philomelus</hi> animated the Phocians mightily, by offering to prove from two verses of <hi>Homer,</hi> that in former times the Temple was under their patronage: whereupon he was made Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral with an ample and unlimited Power, and brought in the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> to join in the War, as being injur'd at the same rate.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. This Delphick Temple and Oracle of <hi>Apollo Pythius</hi> was a very ancient thing. For <hi>Homer</hi> says that <hi>Agamemnon</hi> consulted it before the <hi>Trojan</hi> War. The place upon which it stood was reckon'd the center of <hi>Greece,</hi> and of the World it self; and a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was given out that <hi>Jupiter</hi> started two
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:136207:136"/> Eagles, one to the East, another to the West, which met again in this place, when they had pass'd through equal distances of space. The Oracle took its rise from the Goats that were fed about the Den which made unwonted sounds and uncouth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. At first indeed one gave responses to another, without any difference; but when many people in fits of madness crouded into the Cave, a three footed Machin was inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in which a Woman might stand secure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. That Woman was call'd, <hi>Pythia,</hi> from being intorogated; the first of all was <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monoe.</hi> Virgins were commonly appointed for the Office, till one of 'em was debauch'd by <hi>Echecrates</hi> the <hi>Thessalian,</hi> whereupon Women of 50 years of age were pitch'd upon, who gave the responses in Virgins habits. In former times this Temple was mightily cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, upon the account of the Oracle, the meeting of the <hi>Amphictyones,</hi> the Pythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Games, and its Riches: But in <hi>Strabo</hi>'s time its glory was much eclypsed.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. <hi>Philomelus</hi> cover'd his designs with the highest pretences of Justice and Honesty, and engag'd the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> and <hi>Athenians</hi> on his side; but most of the other <hi>Grecians</hi> thought it their duty to vindicate the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Temple with their Arms, and with that view joyn'd in with the <hi>Thebans;</hi> and the <hi>Amphictyones</hi> back'd their resolution with a Decree, amercing the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> in 1000 Talents more, for not paying the
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:136207:137"/> former Fine within the limited time. But <hi>Philomelus,</hi> finding that the Forces of his Allies design'd to make head against the <hi>Thebans,</hi> seis'd upon the Treasure of the Temple, and hired Soldiers with it: But his attempts prov'd successless, for he either died in Battel, or threw himself headlong over a Rock, in order to avoid the being taken Prisoner by his Enemies.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. <hi>Philomelus</hi> was follow'd by <hi>Onomarchus,</hi> who aided <hi>Lycophron</hi> the Tyrant of the <hi>Phereans</hi> against the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> and <hi>Philip,</hi> whom he defeated twice, and took <hi>Cheronea:</hi> But was afterwards taken Prisoner by <hi>Philip</hi> and strangl'd. To him succeeded <hi>Phayllus</hi> his Brother, who after he had brib'd the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Cities of <hi>Greece</hi> to assist him, died of a Consumption, without doing any memorable action. In the mean time <hi>Philip</hi> took <hi>Methona,</hi> in the Siege of which he lost his eye by a Dart; and snatch'd the Power out of the hands of the <hi>Pherean</hi> Tyrants. Then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving conquer'd some Cities of the <hi>Hellespont</hi> he attack'd the <hi>Olynthians,</hi> thinking that he had strength enough to subdue those, whom both he and his Grandsires had dreaded, and whom himself had by all means endeavour'd to oblige.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. Having defeated the Citizens twice, the Magistrates betray'd the City into his hands, which he levell'd with the ground, and sold the Inhabitants, together with the spoil, for a vast sum of Money; with which he made account to carry on his design of
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:136207:137"/> bribing the <hi>Grecians</hi> to betray their Country. And indeed he found Traitors in every Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and did not stand to own that Gold had aggrandiz'd him more than Steel. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes</hi> caution'd the <hi>Athenians</hi> to be upon their Guard against this art of Bribery: but notwithstanding all their remonstrances he gain'd ground every day, by vertue of his Silver or Golden weapons: and triumphed over the <hi>Athenians</hi> themselves, in obtaining a Peace for Seven Years, having distributed Money among the popular Men, and as some say to <hi>Demosthenes</hi> himself. His design in the Peace was to gain time to get clear of his <hi>Thracian</hi> concerns, in order to bend all his force upon the worrying of <hi>Greece.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="15">15. After his return from <hi>Thrace,</hi> the <hi>Beotians</hi> sollicited him for assistance. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he invaded <hi>Phocis,</hi> and put an end to the War without coming to an engagement: For the greatness of his name mov'd <hi>Phalecus</hi> the <hi>Phocian</hi> General, to desert the <hi>Phocians,</hi> he and his Army having obtain'd leave to go off clear. Thus was the <hi>Phocian</hi> War put to an end after ten years, and the way of punishing the <hi>Phocians</hi> was remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the determination of the <hi>Amphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiones.</hi> They decreed that the two fines in which they were amerc'd should be transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the use of <hi>Philip,</hi> in consideration of his diligence in promoting the interest of the Temple; that they should be excluded from the Temple, and allowed neither Arms
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:136207:138"/> nor Cavalry, till they restored the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures they had carried off; that all their banish'd Men should be taken up by way of reprisal, and attonement; their Towns le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veled with the ground, and their Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants dispersed in Villages, each of 'em consisting of 50 Families, and lying from one another, at the distance of a Furlong; and in fine, that they should pay a yearly Tribute of 60 Talents, till the damage were repair'd.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. This was the sentence given against all the <hi>Phocians,</hi> excepting the <hi>Abaeans</hi> who were the only <hi>Phocians</hi> that kept 'emselves untainted with the Sacrilege. In the mean time <hi>Philip</hi>'s Glory increased apace; and he us'd alluring ways to get himself chosen Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the <hi>Grecians</hi> against the <hi>Persians.</hi> For he had design'd a War against them a long time before. He conquer'd the <hi>Illyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and <hi>Thracians,</hi> and built Castles to awe them to obedience. The next year, being the 18th of <hi>Philip, Arymbas</hi> King of <hi>Molossi</hi> died, and left a Son, namely <hi>Aeacidas</hi> the Father of <hi>Pyrrhus.</hi> Philip turn'd <hi>Aeacidas,</hi> who was then a Child, out of his Kingdom, and put <hi>Alexander</hi> Brother to <hi>Olympias</hi> in his place: Some say, this <hi>Alexander</hi> was made King in the life-time of <hi>Arymbas,</hi> he being outted.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. Then <hi>Philip</hi> attack'd <hi>Perinthus</hi> and <hi>Byzantium,</hi> but without any great success; for the <hi>Persian Satrapae</hi> relieved the former, and the <hi>Athenians</hi> and their Allies raised the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:136207:138"/> Siege of the latter: And by the <hi>Athenian</hi> interest <hi>Greece</hi> joyn'd unanimously in so firm a League, that <hi>Philip</hi> was obliged to make Peace with 'em. About this time <hi>Ateas</hi> King of <hi>Scythia</hi> was assaulted by the <hi>Istrians,</hi> and call'd in <hi>Philip</hi> to his assistance, promising him the right of Succession to his Crown, as a reward: but when the <hi>Istrians</hi> retir'd, he ate in his promise. This incensed <hi>Philip</hi> so, that he invaded <hi>Scythia▪</hi> and took up a great Spoil; but upon his return 'twas all taken from him by the <hi>Triballi,</hi> upon which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion he received a wound in his Thigh that went quite through and kill'd his Horse. <hi>Isocrates</hi> the Orator made use of this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, to write a second Letter to the King, perswading him to Peace, but all in vain.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. For that defeat only encourag'd him to go on more briskly; so that he entred into an Alliance with most of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and since the <hi>Athenians</hi> were the only <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> that thwarted him, he resolved to check them by force of Arms, and surprise 'em unawares. Accordingly he seiz'd upon <hi>Elatea</hi> in <hi>Phocis,</hi> whereupon the <hi>Athenians</hi> were put into a great constirnation; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they fortifi'd themselves as much as was possible fot the time, and got the <hi>Boeotians</hi> to joyn with them. The K. invaded the <hi>Boeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians▪</hi> with 30000 Foot and 20000 Horse, and being superior to his Enemy both in number of Forces and military prudence (for the <hi>Grecians</hi> at this time had no experienc'd Generals) routed them at <hi>Chaeronea.</hi> Here
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:136207:139"/> concludes the liberty of <hi>Greece</hi> and its anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Glory. However, he made but a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate use of his Victory over the <hi>Athenian</hi> Prisoners, and fortified <hi>Thebes:</hi> But accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Justin,</hi> was very severe to the <hi>Thebans.</hi> This Battel was fought at <hi>Chaeronea</hi> in the third year of the 110 Olympiad, in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chonship of <hi>Charonides</hi> or <hi>Charondas,</hi> and the first year of <hi>Arses</hi> King of <hi>Persia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="19">19. The up-shot of this Victory was, that he got himself declared General of the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> against the <hi>Persians,</hi> and a quota of Money and Men laid upon every City. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were the only people that stood out, and contemn'd both him and his terms of Peace. But when he flourish'd so much abroad, his concerns at home were but in an ill condition, upon the account of his divorcing <hi>Olympias</hi> and marrying <hi>Cleopatra</hi> the Grandchild of <hi>Attalus:</hi> For she inces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly push'd on <hi>Alexander</hi> her Son to Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie and hatred. Next spring the King receiv'd a response from the <hi>Oracles</hi> when consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the War, which was as ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as that given to <hi>Croesus</hi> in former times; whereupon he sent <hi>Attalus Amyntas</hi> and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menio</hi> before him into <hi>Asia,</hi> under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of relieving the Grecian Cities.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. Himself was to follow at the head of the Army. But before his departure, he celebrated the Nuptials of his Daughter <hi>Cleopatra</hi> with <hi>Alexander</hi> of <hi>Epirus,</hi> with a great deal of magnificence. But while he display'd his Majesty, and by his Shews
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:136207:139"/> and publick Feasts ingratiated himself with the people; he receiv'd a wound in his side from one <hi>Pausanias,</hi> of which he died im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately. <hi>Attalus</hi> had made <hi>Pausanias</hi> drunk, and abus'd his body, and prostitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to others: And the poor wretch finding that all his sollicitations could not prevail with the King to redress the affront, took this way of resenting the injustice of the Judge. This was the <hi>exit</hi> of <hi>Philip,</hi> in the 24th year of his reign, and the 49th of his Life: A Man that surmounted unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table difficulties, and purchas'd to himself so great an Empire, and instructed so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny war-like and renowned-Men, that both <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> seem'd to wait upon him, and he justly merited a great part of the Glory that ensued upon the Actions of his Son <hi>Alexander.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="21">21. His Son <hi>Alexander</hi> succeeded him in the 20th year of his Age, the first of the 111 Olympiad, in the <hi>Archonship</hi> of <hi>Pytho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus,</hi> the first year of <hi>Darius Codomannus,</hi> A. M. 3669. He descended of <hi>Hercules</hi> on the Father's side, and <hi>Achilles</hi> on the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's. From his infancy his spirit was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and magnanimous; <hi>Aristotle</hi> instructed him in Liberal Arts, and when he came to be of age, he gave signal proofs of his Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. Having celebrated his Father's Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral with a Royal Pomp, he took upon him the administration of Affairs, and first all took care to punish the Regicides. He sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted all the difficulties that stood in
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:136207:140"/> his way by his singular humanity, and an incredible greatness of mind, that was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wanting in him through the whole course of his Life.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. The <hi>Athenians</hi> conspir'd against the new King, upon the sollicitation of <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sthenes;</hi> and <hi>Attalus,</hi> whom the monstrous cruelty of <hi>Olympias</hi> to <hi>Cleopatra</hi> and her young Son had incens'd to the last degree, joyned in with them. The <hi>Etolians</hi> resolv'd to restore the <hi>Acarnanians,</hi> whom <hi>Philip</hi> had banish'd. The Citizens of <hi>Ambracia</hi> turn'd out the Garrison that had been put in upon them, and those of <hi>Thebes</hi> endeavour'd to recover <hi>Cadmea.</hi> The <hi>Arcadians</hi> contemn'd the Son as much as they did the Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and all the other <hi>Peloponnesians</hi> were ready to vindicate their liberty. All these evils were further enflam'd by mutinies of the Nations adjacent to <hi>Macedonia,</hi> who were eager for shaking off the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Yoke.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. But fate had decreed that <hi>Alexander</hi> should master every thing, either by Favour or Force. He took care to get himself de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared General of the <hi>Grecians,</hi> first by the <hi>Thessalians,</hi> and then by the <hi>Amphyctiones,</hi> and after that, having marched at the head of an Army into <hi>Boeotia,</hi> did so fright the rest that a Council was call'd at <hi>Corinth,</hi> which elected him to be General in a War against the <hi>Persians.</hi> Next spring, tho he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd the <hi>Thracians,</hi> and fought successful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against the <hi>Peonians</hi> and <hi>Illyrians,</hi> yet
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:136207:140"/> some Cities revolted, and the <hi>Thebans</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving possess'd themselves of <hi>Cadmea</hi> joyn'd in with the <hi>Athenians,</hi> who were both of 'em push'd on by <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> who rail'd eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally against <hi>Alexander,</hi> as formerly he had done against <hi>Philip,</hi> and honour'd him with no better Title than that of Boy and a Fool.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. The King march'd with full speed to <hi>Boeotia,</hi> whereupon the <hi>Athenians</hi> were discourag'd; but the <hi>Thebans</hi> slighted all the offers that were made 'em, and made all prepartions for undergoing a Siege. <hi>Alexander</hi> indeed was nettled by being diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from carrying on his designs upon <hi>Persia;</hi> and in order to avoid the loss of time, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd 'em very honourable Articles of Peace: But when he perceiv'd that all his proposals met with no other return but rallying and contempt, he laid down a resolution to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish 'em severely for their obstinacy. He easily carry'd the Town, by entring at some Gate or Door that they had neglected. By a Decree of the <hi>Amphectyones,</hi> all the Captives were either Sold or put to Death, because they had conspir'd so often with the King of <hi>Persia;</hi> bating only the Family of <hi>Pinda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> whose houses were left standing by the Conqueror, and none else. By vertue of the above mention'd Decree, this celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted City was level'd to the ground, on the last day of the <hi>Athenian</hi> Sacrifices call'd <hi>Eleusinia,</hi> the 20th of the month <hi>Boedromion,</hi>
                        <pb n="278" facs="tcp:136207:141"/> after it had stood 800 years almost in the same condition.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. <hi>Alexander</hi> publish'd an Edict prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Grecians</hi> to entertain the banish'd persons; which the <hi>Grecians</hi> did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with. Their disobedience reviv'd the former heats, but upon their deprecating the anger of the Conqueror, who at that time had other things in his view, the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence was stifl'd, tho not quite remov'd. This done the King return'd to <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and made all possible preparations for the <hi>Persian</hi> War, from which neither the weight of the Enterprise, nor the desire of having Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, could diswade him. Accordingly in the Spring he march'd to the <hi>Hellespont,</hi> at the head of 34000 Foot, and 4000 Horse, according to the computation of those who speak highest of the Expedition. <hi>Aristobu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> says he had not above 70 Talents for the maintenance of all these Forces; <hi>Datis</hi> writes he had Provisions only for 30 days, and some other Author says, he ow'd 200 Talents at that time.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. However before he set out, he divided almost all <hi>Macedonia</hi> among his Captains; and when <hi>Perdiocas</hi> put the question, what he would leave to himself, he made answer, that <hi>hope</hi> should be his Portion. He transported his Army to <hi>Troas</hi> in 60 Ships, and was the first who set foot in <hi>Asia,</hi> in a jumping capering manner, throwing his Spear upon the ground in the Second year of his Reign, the Second of
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:136207:141"/>
                        <hi>Darius Codomannus,</hi> the Third of the 111 O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympiad, in the Archonship of <hi>Enaenetus</hi> (that is in the 3d Month before he resign'd his office, on the behalf of <hi>Ctesides,</hi> under whose Government <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> says this Expedition was undertaken) A.

                     <p n="27">27. He committed the administration of his inland affairs to <hi>Antipater,</hi> and left 12000 Foot and 1500 Horse. After the King's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> waited impatiently for an occasion to make a new stir; and after the Battel at <hi>Arbela</hi> most of the Cities resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to vindicate their liberty to the last ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, before the <hi>Persians</hi> should be total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cut off. Accordingly <hi>Antipater</hi> being engag'd in quelling the Rebels that <hi>Memnon</hi> had stir'd up in <hi>Thrace,</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> made use of that opportunity to perswade the <hi>Grecians</hi> to revolt. But <hi>Antipater</hi> setled the affairs of <hi>Thrace</hi> at what rate he could, and having marched against the Grecians routed them in a bloody Battel, in which <hi>Agis</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> King and General of the Army died among many others.</p>
                     <p n="28">28. After this success, <hi>Antipater</hi> thought it convenient to make an end of the War, lest he should seem to carry it further than was suitable to the modesty of a Subject. He was well acquainted with <hi>Alexander</hi>'s tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and knew that the Victory was only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him, when the Victor was not, and that he look'd upon his own Glory to be eclips'd in proportion to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of another Man's. And upon that
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:136207:142"/> account, when the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> sought Peace, he remitted them to the Council of <hi>Greece,</hi> which received the complaints of both parties, and gave the King an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the whole matter. The <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> gave <hi>Antipater</hi> 50 Hostages, and sent Ambassadors to <hi>Alexander</hi> to ask his Pardon.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. <hi>SIcily</hi> is an Island in the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, that lies opposite to <hi>Italy. Thu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cydides</hi> says, it lies 20 furlongs off from the Continent, and that its Circumference is as much as a great Ship can sail in 8 days time.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It was first call'd <hi>Trinacria,</hi> from its triangular form, then <hi>Sicania,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Sicily.</hi> The Inhabitants of it were the <hi>Cyclopes,</hi> or <hi>Lestrygones,</hi> as also the <hi>Sicani</hi> and <hi>Siculi;</hi> for the story of the one's coming from <hi>Spain,</hi> and the other from <hi>Italy,</hi> is justly look'd upon as fabulous. For the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cani</hi> and <hi>Siculi</hi> were not distinguish'd by
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:136207:143"/> their originals, but by the place of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence. Several Colonies were carried thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and these built several Cities. The <hi>Phenicians</hi> likewise possessed the maritim places, especially those about <hi>Lilybaeum:</hi> And the famous <hi>Sam. Bochart</hi> shews that both the Island it self, and its chief Rivers and noted places had their names from the <hi>Phenicians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Justinus</hi> writes, that when the <hi>Cyclopes</hi> were extinct, <hi>Cocalus</hi> possessed the Island, to whom <hi>Daedalus</hi> the famous <hi>Athenian</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect fled from before <hi>Minos</hi> of <hi>Crete.</hi> This <hi>Daedalus</hi> had kill'd his own Grand child and Disciple, that was like to out-do him in his Art, and went to <hi>Creet,</hi> where he incurr'd the King's hatred upon some busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that related to Queen <hi>Pasiphae. Minos</hi> follow'd him to <hi>Inycum</hi> or <hi>Camicum</hi> the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of <hi>Cocalus,</hi> where <hi>Cocalus</hi>'s Daughters entic'd him to come into the House, and sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled him in a Bath. 'Tis thought that <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalus</hi> escap'd in a Ship by <hi>Pasiphae</hi>'s interest, and invented the use of Sails in the room of <hi>Oars,</hi> which were only known before; from whence the Fable goes, that he made wings to himself and fled away. 'Tis likewise belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that <hi>Icarus</hi> his Son followed the Father in another Ship, and for want of skill to manage the new-invented Sail, was drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Sea. Now the death of this younger <hi>Minos</hi> happen'd in the time of the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Hercules,</hi> in the age preceeding the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan</hi> times.</p>

                        <pb n="283" facs="tcp:136207:143"/>4. After <hi>Cocalus, Justin</hi> says that the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties came into the hands of Tyrants, of which no Country was more fertil than this. But for so much as the Tyrants who oppress'd the <hi>Grecian</hi> Cities were truely <hi>Grecians,</hi> and <hi>Cocalus</hi> lived in the age pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the <hi>Trojan</hi> War, and that there was no <hi>Grecian</hi> Cities founded in <hi>Sicily</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the 11 Olympiad, it seems plain that there was an interval of 500 or 600 years between <hi>Cocalus</hi> and the Tyrants. For it is not possible but that these Colonies must have us'd the same form of Government for several years, that the <hi>Metropolitans</hi> had, till the times of <hi>Phalaris,</hi> who usurp'd the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny at <hi>Agrigentum,</hi> about the 54th O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympiad.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Phalaris</hi> was born at <hi>Astypalaea,</hi> and lost his Father <hi>Laodamus</hi> when he was yet a Child. He marry'd <hi>Erythia,</hi> and was bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed a little before the birth of his Son <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolas.</hi> After a great deal of adversity he was call'd in by the people of <hi>Agrigentum,</hi> at a time when they labour'd under Sedition, and had the Administration of Affairs put into his hands. As he came to the Crown by fraud and cruelty, so he maintain'd it by the same methods. <hi>Perilius</hi> a famous <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Carver, presented him with a noble Machin, or a Bull of Brass, for burning Men alive, and himself was justly doom'd to make the first tryal of it.</p>

He was certainly a Monster of a Man, full of unheard of cruelty and hatred, but very bounteous to his friends, and one that had such a regard for Vertue, that for the sake of that alone he would forgive of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences. His Life was not laid wait for, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the other Tyrants were, but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the <hi>Agrigentins</hi> fell openly upon him, after he had display'd his Cruelty for 16 years.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. After the Death of <hi>Phalaris,</hi> the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Agrigentum</hi> maintained their liberty, till <hi>Thoron</hi> the Son of <hi>Aenesidamus</hi> invaded the Tyranny. At the same time <hi>Panaetius</hi> made himself master of <hi>Leontium:</hi> And <hi>Cleander</hi> of <hi>Gela.</hi> After seven years this Man was follow'd by <hi>Hyppocrates,</hi> who sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued the <hi>Naxii, Zanclaei,</hi> the Inhabitants of <hi>Messana</hi> and the <hi>Leontines.</hi> He wag'd War with the <hi>Syracusians,</hi> from whom he took <hi>Camarina,</hi> and after seven years died in a Battel with the <hi>Siculi.</hi> He committed his children to the care of <hi>Gelon,</hi> who negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting his trust possess'd himself of <hi>Gela,</hi>
                        <pb n="285" facs="tcp:136207:144"/> and afterwards, when a difference arose between the people of <hi>Syracusa</hi> and their Magistrates, he being solicited to assist the Magistrates that were then in exile, wheedl'd the common people, and by degrees ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peas'd both parties, and usurp'd the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the second year of the 72 Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad, in the Archonship of <hi>Hibrilis,</hi> in the 31 of <hi>Darius,</hi> the same year in which the Battel of <hi>Marathon</hi> was fought betwixt the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Persians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Syracusa</hi> was formerly the Seat of some <hi>Etolians,</hi> and went by the name of <hi>Ortygia.</hi> The <hi>Etolians</hi> were expelled by the <hi>Siculi,</hi> as the <hi>Siculi</hi> were by that Colony which <hi>Archias</hi> the <hi>Corinthian</hi> headed about the 11 Olympiad, in the reign of <hi>Romulus</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the time of the <hi>Messenian</hi> War. But that City was so much enlarg'd by confluences of people from all other places of the <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> that <hi>Cicero</hi> call'd it the largest and the prettiest of all the <hi>Grecian</hi> Cities. It consisted of four Cities, namely <hi>Insula, Acradina, Tycha,</hi> and <hi>Neapolis.</hi> It had two large Havens, besides the Suburbs. The Colony that <hi>Archias</hi> brought in were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to <hi>Aristocracy,</hi> for at that time such was the form of Government at <hi>Corinth.</hi> Afterwards the fierce and turbulent people gave rise to several seditions and alterations, and the more they avoided Monarchy, the more they were gall'd by Tyranny.</p>
                     <p n="3">
                        <pb n="286" facs="tcp:136207:145"/>3. But <hi>Gelon</hi> made such a moderate use of his power, that he was lov'd by all and hated by none, and did so ingratiate himself with all the <hi>Siculi,</hi> that he offered to assist the <hi>Grecians,</hi> when engag'd in the <hi>bellum Medicum,</hi> with 200 Galleys, and as numerous an Army as <hi>Greece</hi> it self was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make up against <hi>Xerxes,</hi> providing they wou'd have given him the command either of the Fleet or the Army. But that being deny'd, he bended his force against the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> whom the <hi>Egestans</hi> had call'd into <hi>Sicily,</hi> and routed them in a bloody Battel, on the same day that the Grecians fought at <hi>Salamina,</hi> insomuch that he seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to vie with <hi>Themistocles</hi> himself. But now that I have mentioned the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> it will not be improper to give a short ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the original of their City, and trace its rising from such small beginnings, to be able to dispute the Empire of the World.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Carthage</hi> was built by the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> who in ancient times were Lords of the Sea, and transported Colonies to all the Maritim places. It consisted of several parts, which were built at several times, from whence the diversity of their <hi>Epocha's</hi> arises. <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pianus</hi> would have have it built about 50 years before the taking of <hi>Troy,</hi> and that by <hi>Tsorus</hi> and <hi>Carchedon,</hi> because <hi>Tsor</hi> and <hi>Zor</hi> are <hi>Phenician</hi> words for a Metropolitan, and <hi>Charchedon</hi> for the Town it self, and <hi>Carthada</hi> in the <hi>Phenician</hi> Language signifies
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:136207:145"/> a new City. <hi>Strabo</hi> alledges that the <hi>Pheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> transported Colonies to the <hi>Columnae Herculis</hi> or straits of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> about the time of the <hi>Trojan</hi> War, in which time <hi>Virgil,</hi> either out of a poetick licence, or thro ignorance, makes <hi>Dido</hi> to live, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain <hi>Aeneas</hi> in his Pilgrimage.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Eusebius</hi> says that by some computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>Carthage</hi> was built in the 143 year after the destruction of <hi>Troy;</hi> but <hi>Menander</hi> the <hi>Ephesian,</hi> who translated the <hi>Tyrian</hi> Annals into <hi>Greek,</hi> writes that <hi>Dido</hi> built the City in the 78 year of <hi>Pygmalion,</hi> 143 years and 8 months after the building the Temple at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and 300 years after the destruction of <hi>Troy;</hi> so that this computation makes it 164 years later than <hi>Eusebius</hi>'s.</p>
                     <p>It would seem therefore that <hi>Cotho</hi> or the 1st part of the Town adjacent to the Harbour was built before the <hi>Trojan</hi> War, but <hi>Megara</hi> or <hi>Magalia,</hi> and <hi>Magaria</hi> (which signifies dewl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in a strange Land) was built within 144 years after the destruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> and <hi>Byrsa</hi> or the Castle was built by <hi>Dido</hi> 166 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that. For as soon as the <hi>Canaanites</hi> were outted of their Seats by the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and dwelt upon the Sea side under the name of <hi>Phenicians,</hi> they sent out Colonies, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ever after so to do, insomuch that they built several Cities besides this in <hi>Africa,</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, <hi>Ʋtica</hi> or <hi>Ityca,</hi> which in the <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nician</hi> dialect signifies <hi>Ancient.</hi>

                        <pb n="288" facs="tcp:136207:146"/>7. <hi>Dido</hi> was the Sister of <hi>Pygmalion</hi> King of <hi>Tyre,</hi> and Wife to <hi>Sicheus Hercules</hi>'s Priest. When her Husband was put to death by the King, she fled with her Riches to <hi>Africa,</hi> and so disappointed the Parricide of his Booty. The story goes, that when she arriv'd, she bought as much Land from the <hi>Libyans,</hi> as she could surround with an Ox-hide, and having obtain'd her request, cut out the hide into small thongs, and with them measur'd out 20 Acres, upon which she built a Castle, that from thence was call'd <hi>Byrsa.</hi> But the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed world look upon that story as fabulous, and alledge that the Fable took its rise from hence, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Bosra,</hi> which signifies a fortified place, was <hi>euphoniae gratiae,</hi> turn'd to <hi>Byrsa,</hi> by reason that the Grecian Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue will not suffer the conjunction of the two Letters S and R.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. At last the Queen laid violent hands on her self, in order to avoid the necessity of marrying <hi>Hiarbas</hi> King of <hi>Mauritania.</hi> This <hi>Dido,</hi> which signifies <hi>Lovely,</hi> or as some will have it, <hi>Wandering,</hi> was formerly, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l'd <hi>Elissa,</hi> or a Divine Woman, and <hi>Virago.</hi> Now <hi>Virago</hi> is a Latin word, which in Greek Letters was writ <hi>Ouirago,</hi> and in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi> we find it corrupted to <hi>Origo,</hi> which did mightily puzle <hi>Joseph Scaliger</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who thought it referr'd to the City, and not to the Woman.</p>
                     <p n="9">
                        <pb n="289" facs="tcp:136207:146"/>9. <hi>Carthage</hi> therefore was repair'd or enlarg'd by <hi>Dido</hi> in the 3132 year of the World, in the reign of <hi>Joas</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> and <hi>Jehu</hi> King of <hi>Israel,</hi> 310 years after the destruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> 97 before the 1 Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad, and 120 before the building of <hi>Rome.</hi> At first it had Kings, but afterwards it shak'd off the Monarchy, and after that groan'd long under Sedition, and the other evils that retain to the boundless power of the people. The <hi>Philosopher</hi> compares this <hi>Republick</hi> to the <hi>Cretian</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Governments, as being of a mix'd kind. <hi>Polybius</hi> says it was compounded of a <hi>Regal, Aristocratical,</hi> and <hi>Democratical</hi> power: and <hi>Socrates</hi> says it was <hi>Oligarchical</hi> at home, and <hi>Monarchical</hi> in time of War.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. In <hi>Carthage</hi> the administration of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs was committed to two Men, who were call'd <hi>Suffetes</hi> or <hi>Sophetim,</hi> the same name that was given to the Judges of <hi>Israel.</hi> These two <hi>Suffetes,</hi> did in some measure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble the two <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Kings, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly <hi>Aristotle, Polybius,</hi> and others stile them Kings; however, they were only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for one year, upon which account <hi>Livy</hi> compares 'em to the Roman Consuls. Additional to them was the <hi>Senate,</hi> which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi> compares to that of <hi>Lacedemon;</hi> whose Derees had the authority of a <hi>Law,</hi> if back'd by the <hi>Suffetes;</hi> but if otherwise, the matter was remitted to the Common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. Now in this Common Council <hi>Aristotle</hi> finds fault with two things: one is, that
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:136207:147"/> every little fellow was allow'd to give his Opinion and contradict the Magistrates; the other defect was, that nothing could be safely objected, against the unjustest act of that Common Council.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Over and above the Senate, there was another Court of 104 Members, who from the round number were call'd a <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumvirat:</hi> These are compared by <hi>Aristotle</hi> to the Society of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> and therefore are to be accounted Judges and Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of the liberty of the people. In this <hi>Republick</hi> we likewise meet with <hi>Censores mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> and <hi>Praetors,</hi> who took care of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes and made Laws; besides several o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Magistrates. Among other errors in the constitution of this Republick, <hi>Aristotle</hi> takes notice of this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Suffetes</hi> were chosen with regard to their Riches, and that one and the same Man had several Offices: To which we may add a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous custom of sacrificing their own Children in time of Calamity, which it seems they brought along with them from <hi>Phaenicia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">12. Another unaccountable thing was, that their Subjects were prohibited to understand <hi>Greek,</hi> by reason that one <hi>Suni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator</hi> had discovered their secret designs to <hi>Dionysius Major</hi> in the Greek Language. But their prohibiting Drunkenness, and presenting their Soldiers with golden Rings, was certainly laudable. The people were of a very morose temper, extreme obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:136207:147"/> to their Magistrates, tryrannical to their Subjects, timorous in adversity, infinitely cruel in their anger, steady and unshaken in their Counsels, but withal so faithless that <hi>fides punica</hi> became a Proverb.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. We are at a loss to know certainly, at what time, or upon what occasion the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> first invaded <hi>Sicily. Livy</hi> says, they were first invited thither by the Islan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, in the Consulships of <hi>T. Quintius Cincinnatus</hi> and <hi>Cn. Julius Mento,</hi> in the 323 year of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and about the 40th after <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s Expedition, in the beginning of the <hi>Peloponnesian</hi> War; but he is strangely out in this point, for <hi>Gelon</hi> routed the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi> at <hi>Himaera,</hi> at the same time that the <hi>Grecians</hi> defeated <hi>Xerxes</hi>'s Fleet at <hi>Salamina.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="14">14. <hi>Justin</hi> from <hi>Trogus,</hi> says, that after they had carried on a successless War in <hi>Sicily</hi> a long while, they turn'd the dint of their Wars upon <hi>Sardinia;</hi> and that <hi>God</hi> was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with them for offering up humane Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices. In <hi>Sardinia</hi> they were likewise routed, upon which the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were so incens'd, that they prohibited <hi>Mazaeus</hi> and the remains of the Army to return. But the Soldiers could not brook their exile, but besieged and took <hi>Carthage,</hi> and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Men that advised it.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. <hi>Mazaeus</hi> was put to death for affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Tyranny, and <hi>Magus</hi> succeeded him, who introduc'd the Military Discipline, and by so doing laid the foundation of their
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:136207:148"/> Empire. He left two Sons, namely, <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drubal</hi> and <hi>Amilcar;</hi> under whose conduct this Common-wealth carried on a War in <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and fought with the <hi>Africans,</hi> who requir'd a yearly tribute as the ground-rent of the City, and then obtain'd it. <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drubal</hi> died in <hi>Sardinia</hi> of his wounds, after he had made himself famous by four Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs, and being <hi>Dictator</hi> 11 times. After his death their enemies took heart, and the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> who had been incessantly injured by them, implor'd the assistance of <hi>Leonidas</hi> brother to the King of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> which gave occasion to a heavy and doubtful War.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. About this time <hi>Darius</hi> the Son of <hi>Hystaspes,</hi> prohibited them by his Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors to offer up humane Sacrifices, to eat Man's flesh, or to burn their Dead; and with all commanded them to send Auxiliary Troops against the <hi>Grecians. Justin</hi> says they comply'd with all these his demands: But if it be so, 'tis plain from <hi>Plato, Diodorus</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> that they afterwards alter'd their minds. Soon after, <hi>Amilcar</hi> was kill'd in <hi>Sicily,</hi> and left three Sons, namely, <hi>Amilco, Hanno,</hi> and <hi>Giscon: Asdrubal</hi> having like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise left as many, namely, <hi>Hannibal, Asdru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> and <hi>Sappho.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="17">17. This is that <hi>Amilcar,</hi> who died in the Battel against <hi>Gelon,</hi> in the 6th year of <hi>Xer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes;</hi> and it was at the <hi>Carthagenian</hi> disaster on that occasion that we stopp'd, and made this digression of the <hi>Republick</hi> of <hi>Carthage.</hi>
                        <pb n="293" facs="tcp:136207:148"/> There fell together with <hi>Amilcar</hi> 150000 Soldiers, and thereupon the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were oblig'd to sollicit for Peace. Some allege that they engag'd in this War with a design to hinder the Cities of <hi>Sicily</hi> to assist the Grecians. Afterwards the Kingdom of <hi>Sicily</hi> was proffer'd to <hi>Gelon,</hi> but he rejected it, and by so doing gain'd a great deal of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. He continu'd in his Principality 13 years.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. <hi>Gelon</hi> dy'd in the third year of the 75 Olympiad, and his Brother <hi>Hiero</hi> succeeded, who rebuilt <hi>Catana</hi> and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened it <hi>Aetna,</hi> their being a Mountain of that name, which at that very time did cast up fire, and break out into a flame. This Prince was at first Greedy, Cruel, Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and Turbulent; but the precepts of learned Men reclaim'd him. He fought suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessfully with the <hi>Carthaginians:</hi> But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards incurring the hatred of the Citizens, went to <hi>Catana</hi> where he died in the 2 year of the 78th Olympiad, and after he had go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd 11 years and 8 months. After <hi>Hiero Thrasybulus</hi> his Brother succeeded. He was the worst of all the Tyrants, and after 10 months being expell'd by the <hi>Syracusans,</hi> fled to <hi>Locri</hi> in the borders of <hi>Italy,</hi> where he killed himself, and by that means the Citizens retriev'd their liberty.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. The <hi>Syracusans</hi> having thus recover'd their liberty, were quickly infested with great Seditions, by denying an equality of right in the <hi>Republick,</hi> to those whom <hi>Gelon</hi> had made free in the City, for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:136207:149"/> of his own interest. But these were reduc'd by War, and at the same time all Forreigners were expell'd all the Cities in the Isle, and fled to <hi>Messana.</hi> This was the form of the <hi>Republick</hi> of <hi>Syracusa</hi> in those days, which <hi>Aristotle</hi> gives out to be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of <hi>Oligarchy</hi> and <hi>Democracy;</hi> but the weakness of their foundation did soon after appear, when <hi>Tindarides</hi> having ingratiated himself with the common people, did almost establish a Tyranny over them; for tho he was kill'd in the croud, yet others pursu'd the same design. Being surrounded with such evils, they imitated the <hi>Athenians</hi> in intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the <hi>Petalismus,</hi> by which they doom'd those who had an uncommon power or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, to five years exile. The word <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talismus</hi> took rise from their writing the names of the banish'd persons on Olive Leaves or some plate of metal. But expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience taught them that this remedy was more dangerous than the disease, because when the better sort of people and those that were fit for business were sent out of the way, the administration of affairs came into the hands of scandalous and impudent fellows. At last the people being sensible of its pernicious Consequences abrogated the <hi>Petalismus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="20">20. This was the state of the <hi>Syracusan</hi>'s affairs at home, when they set their minds on War, in which they subdued several Cities. and in regard that <hi>Leontium</hi> affected the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of <hi>Sicily,</hi> took it and leveled it with the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:136207:149"/> ground, transporting their Gentry to <hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusa,</hi> and banishing the Mob. After these domestick commotions they engaged in a War with the <hi>Athenians,</hi> in the first year of the 91 Olympiad, of which above <hi>Syracusa</hi> was thereby so exhausted in their Blood and Treasure, that it was only owing to <hi>Gelip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> that they surviv'd such heavy evils, and gave the <hi>Athenians</hi> a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable overthrow. That victory did so puff up the people, that they were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with their present condition, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected greater power.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. <hi>Diocles,</hi> an Austere Eloquent and prudent Man, advis'd the people to appoint their Magistrates, not by voting, but by lot. At this rate the Administration of Affairs sometimes came into the hands of unskilful Men, and in regard that so wise a Man as <hi>Diocles</hi> could not but foresee that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, 'tis thought he made that Law only to answer the present juncture, and when the Government was afterwards set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led abolish'd it, However it is very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that he having made a law prohibiting any Man to come with Arms into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Council, by an oversight committed the Crime himself, and least the Law should suffer by it, presently drew his Sword and stabb'd himself. He was a rigid and impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable corrector of Vice, but withal nicely just: and his Laws were so much esteemed that they were receiv'd in most places in <hi>Sicily:</hi> tho <hi>Cephalus</hi> and <hi>Polydorus</hi> were afterwards
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:136207:150"/> imploy'd to make Laws, yet they were not reckon'd Legislators, but only Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators upon his Laws.</p>
                     <p n="22">22. But all this was not sufficient to remedy the inconveniencies that attend <hi>Democracy,</hi> while Men of Sense and Prudence were kept under, and the heedless Mob were invested with power. This gave rise to jealousie, envy, and factious designs, and these to ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny it self. For <hi>Dionysius</hi> the Son of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocrates,</hi> a great Master of the art of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling, did so wheedle the people with his harangues, that he obtain'd a Lifeguard for the safety of his Person, and by that means establish'd himself on the Throne, in the 8 year after the defeat of the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> the 4th of the 93 Olympiad, the same year in which <hi>Athens</hi> fell into the hands of <hi>Lysander.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="23">23. He first ingratiated himself with the people in the Wars with the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> Now the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had fought successful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under the conduct of <hi>Amilcar,</hi> and <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drubal,</hi> against the <hi>Moors</hi> and <hi>Numidians;</hi> and oblig'd the <hi>Africans</hi> to discharge the Tribute that they used to pay for the ground of their City. In regard that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milcar</hi>'s Family was very numerous, and seem'd to threaten the <hi>Republick,</hi> they pitch'd upon 100 Senators as Commissioners to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect into the actions of their Generals. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Amilcar</hi> his Son <hi>Amilco</hi> succeeded, who after several Victories had the mortification to see his Army consumed by a Plague, and
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:136207:150"/> thereupon kill'd himself. He was follow'd by <hi>Hannibal,</hi> Son to his Brother <hi>Gisgon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="24">24. <hi>Hannibal</hi> exercis'd his spleen against the <hi>Grecians,</hi> in resentment of his Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Amilcar</hi>'s death; and accordingly inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Sicily</hi> with a numerous Army, and took <hi>Selinus</hi> and <hi>Himera.</hi> But <hi>Hannibal</hi> died of the Plague, and <hi>Amilcar</hi> his Collegue took <hi>Agrigentum,</hi> a City that was admirably well provided with Men and all other things; and transported a great many Ornaments to <hi>Africa,</hi> and among the rest <hi>Phalaris</hi> his brazen Bull, which, 'tis said <hi>Scipio Africanus Minor,</hi> returned to the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> upon the taking of <hi>Carthage,</hi> 260 years after. The destruction of <hi>Agrigentum</hi> seem'd to imply the defeat of all <hi>Sicily;</hi> and thereupon the <hi>Syracusan</hi> Generals, who had been sent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others to assist the besieged, were ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign'd of neglecting their duty.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. But <hi>Dionysius</hi> openly charg'd them with Treachery, as if they could have rais'd the Siege if they would, and mov'd that they should be punish'd out of hand, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out waiting the time prescrib'd by the Law. From Hence he took occasion to arraign the Nobility, as conspiring with the Generals to introduce an <hi>Olygarachy;</hi> and was proud of appearing to be a Patron of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and an asserter of their Liberty. By this means he ingratiated himself with the Soldiers, and first got himself made one of the Generals, and afterwards ingross'd the Post to himself, having remov'd his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues by false accusations. Then he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:136207:151"/> loudly of a great Conspiracy against him, and so obtain'd a Lifeguard of 600 Men for the safety of his Person, which he afterwards inlarg'd at pleasure, and got his enemies condemned by a publick Decree. By this means he rais'd himself from the station of a sorry little <hi>Clerk,</hi> to the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Lord</hi> of the greatest of all the Grecian Cities.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. However <hi>Amilcar,</hi> having raz'd <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grigentum,</hi> took <hi>Gela,</hi> and would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd his march further, had not a griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Plague oblig'd him to make Peace with <hi>Dionysius,</hi> and transport the remainder of his Army to <hi>Africa.</hi> The <hi>Syracusans</hi> oppos'd <hi>Dionysius</hi> to the utmost, but he made a brave defence; and having brought his affairs to a settlement, renew'd the War with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> from whom he alienated se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Cities. Next Spring the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> sent <hi>Amilco</hi> with a numerous Army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Sicily,</hi> who took several Cities, and laid Siege to <hi>Syracusa.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="27">27. But the <hi>Syracusans</hi> defeated their Fleet, and took the Admiral-ship: by which Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory they were so puffed up, that they once more attempted the recovery of their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. At length the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Army was wasted with a wonderful Plague, and at the same time their retreat was intercepted by the <hi>Syracusans,</hi> insomuch that their General was oblig'd to purchase leave to retreat of <hi>Dionysius,</hi> at the rate of 300 Talents: for <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onysius</hi> did not desire to see the <hi>Carthaginians</hi>
                        <pb n="299" facs="tcp:136207:151"/> lower, for fear his Subjects being secure up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that side, should offer to coap with their Tyrant.</p>
                     <p n="28">28. Afterwards the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> sent fresh Forces into <hi>Sicily,</hi> and renewed the War, in which <hi>Dionysius</hi> was again the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. The Tyrant being puffed up by such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary success, attack'd <hi>Rhegium</hi> thrice, in resentment of some affront that the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens had given him, and at last starved them out, and sold 'em. Having thus setled his Affairs, and being in a manner idle, he gave his mind altogether to Poetry, and among other Philosophers invited <hi>Plato</hi> to come to him, who by speaking a little freely of the duty of a Prince, was in great danger of his Life, and at length was sold for five pounds, whereupon the Philosophers ransom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. After this interval of Peace the War was renewed with the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> with various success, but soon after a truce was concluded upon, and <hi>Dionysius</hi> died ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through hard drinking, or by the Treachery of his Eldest Son, after he had reign'd in <hi>Syracusa</hi> 58 years, in the first year of the 103 Olympiad, 366 before <hi>Christ,</hi> A. M. 3637.</p>
                     <p n="29">29. This was that famous Tyrant, who committed his person, not to Friends but to Strangers, and to the most cruel and barbarous Men; who taught his own Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to Shave, in order to avoid the danger of trusting his Throat to a Barber; who took the Razour from them when they
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:136207:152"/> came to be of age, and ordered them to burn off his hair with burning Walnut-shells; who came to his Wives at night, in such a manner that he try'd and search'd every thing before-hand; who did not dare to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue the people from the ordinary Desk, but made use of a Tower for the purpose; and who shewed <hi>Democles</hi> the Parasit, the true nature of the felicity he had spoke of, by regaling him with all sorts of Plenty, and Instruments of Luxury and Pleasure, a glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Sword being at the same time hung by a Horse-hair just over his Head.</p>
                     <p n="30">30. <hi>Dionysius</hi> marri'd two Wives, on one and the same day, namely, <hi>Doris a Locrian,</hi> and <hi>Aristomache</hi> Daughter to <hi>Hipparinus,</hi> and Sister to <hi>Dion. Dion</hi> was about to solicit the Tyrant, when a dying, on the behalf of his Nephews, that is, that they might succeed to part of the Kingdom; but <hi>Dionysius</hi> his Son by the former Wife, being then of age, smell'd the design, and, as the story goes, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd the Physicians to give his Father a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, which set him a sleeping, so that he never waked. By this means <hi>Dionysius</hi> succeeded to his Father.</p>
                     <p n="31">31. At first he made a shew of Virtue, and was the object of all mens hopes: among other Philosophers he sent for <hi>Plato</hi> twice. Afterwards he gradually degenerated to Luxury and Laziness, and became an enemy to Virtue; he treated <hi>Plato</hi> with horrid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities, and banish'd <hi>Dion. Dion</hi> drew to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a body of hir'd Troops at <hi>Corinth,</hi>
                        <pb n="301" facs="tcp:136207:152"/> and with them invaded <hi>Sicily:</hi> when he came there, his Forces were dayly enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, insomuch that he soon expell'd the Tyrant. But the <hi>Syracusans</hi> made an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful return to the asserter of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and defrauded the Soldiers of their Pay. Afterwards it happened that the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison which <hi>Dionysius</hi> left in the Castle, sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied out upon the Town, and maul'd them sadly; whereupon <hi>Dion</hi> was called in to their assistance, who came and suppress'd their Enemies, and then was made General. But he was always engag'd in mortal feuds with his rivals, and at last was circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by one <hi>Callicrates</hi> a most perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and villainous Man, and was murder'd by several assassins, in the 55 year of his age, and the fourth after his return from <hi>Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponnesus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="32">32. After the Death of <hi>Dion, Callicrates</hi> made himself Tyrant, but after thirteen months was expell'd by <hi>Hippacinus</hi> Son to <hi>Dionysius</hi> the Elder by <hi>Aristomache. Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacinus</hi> govern'd two years, and then was follow'd by one <hi>Nasaeus,</hi> whom <hi>Dionysius</hi> outted in the midst of his security, and so recover'd the Government of <hi>Syracusa</hi> in the 10th year of his Exile. In that interval of time he had made himself master of the <hi>Locrians</hi> upon the Sea Coast in <hi>Italy,</hi> and had mightily oppressed the Citizens, for 6 years with murders and rapes. 'Twas the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> of these <hi>Locrians</hi> that <hi>Paleucus</hi> the famous <hi>Legislator</hi> modell'd, of whom elsewhere.</p>
                     <p n="33">
                        <pb n="302" facs="tcp:136207:153"/>33. When <hi>Dionysius</hi> retrieved the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the <hi>Syracusans</hi> were more inclin'd for <hi>Icetas</hi> the Governour of <hi>Leontium:</hi> However the former retain'd the power. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> took occasion to attack the <hi>Syracusans</hi> at a time when they were harassed by Seditions. The <hi>Syracusans</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves in great straits, implor'd the assistance of <hi>Corinth,</hi> who sent <hi>Timoleon</hi> to them, a Man that was an inveterate enemy to Tyranny, and had suffer'd his own Brother to be put to death for aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at it. When he came to <hi>Syracusa</hi> he repuls'd the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and with ease expell'd <hi>Icetas</hi> and <hi>Dionysius;</hi> the latter of whom came to <hi>Corinth,</hi> where he taught a School, and liv'd in great want. When <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedonia</hi> ask'd why he did not keep up the Power that his Father left him, 'tis said he made answer, that his Father indeed left him his Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but not his Fortune. This was the exit of the Tyranny of the <hi>Dionysius</hi>'s, after it had lasted 64 years, in the second year of the 100 Olympiad, <hi>A. M.</hi> 3661.</p>
                     <p n="34">34. However <hi>Icetas</hi> having a design upon <hi>Syracusa,</hi> brought back the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> in order to attack the Town. <hi>Timoleon</hi> first rais'd the Siege, and cut 'em almost all off; and when <hi>Icetas</hi> and <hi>Mamercus</hi> Tyrant of <hi>Catana,</hi> had brought them back to the Island, he routed their joynt Forces, took and kill'd <hi>Icetas</hi> and his Son, and obliged the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> to sollicit for Peace.
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:136207:153"/>
                        <hi>Mamercus</hi> indeed fled, but afterwards sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered himself and was put to death. <hi>Timoleon</hi> rescu'd all the rest of the Cities out of the hands of their Tyrants, and in regard that <hi>Syracusa</hi> was almost ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted with the bloody War, took care to have it publickly proclaim'd in <hi>Greece</hi> by a Herald, that the <hi>Syracusans</hi> offer'd grounds and houses to any that would live among them, whereupon many repair'd thither, and the Inhabitants of the City became very numerous.</p>
                     <p n="35">35. <hi>Timoleon</hi> being free from War, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed himself wholly to settle the state of the <hi>Republick,</hi> and reviv'd the Democratical form of Government, having employ'd one <hi>Cephalus</hi> and <hi>Dionysius</hi> at <hi>Corinth</hi> to interpret the Laws of <hi>Diocles.</hi> He order'd the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to chuse a new Magistrate every year, who shou'd be stil'd <hi>Servant to Jupiter O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympius,</hi> in memory of the restoration of their liberty. Afterwards he became blind, but still was not wanting in serving the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick.</hi> At last he was worn out with old Age, and solemnly Inter'd by an unversal confluence of the <hi>Sicilians.</hi> He died in the 38 year of his Government, the last of the 110 Olympiad, the last of <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> the 2 of <hi>Arses</hi> the <hi>Persian,</hi> the 7th be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Commencement of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> Empire, <hi>A.

But when the Prince usurped the rights of the Magistrates, especially of the Consuls and Tribunes; their office was to call the Senate, pass Judgments, give Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, make Servants Free, Farm the Taxes, and to solemnize the publick Games: And besides, their names continued to give the Characteristick to the year, as before. While the Republick was in a flourishing conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if any surprising or dangerous acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent happen'd, they were invested with full power to act as they thought fit, by vertue of an Act of the Senate, conceiv'd in these words, <hi>Viderint Consules, ne quid detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti Resp. capiat,</hi> i. e. <hi>May the Consuls take care, that the Republick come to no harm.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Those who first hansell'd the Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, were <hi>L. Junius Brutus,</hi> and <hi>L. Tarqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Collatinus,</hi> who were made Consuls in the beginning of the 68 Olympiad, in which <hi>Ischomachus</hi> of <hi>Croaton</hi> was Victor, in the Arc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honship of <hi>Isagrus.</hi> These two new Consuls at first had Twelve Axes carried before them, as well as before the Kings, but in order to
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:136207:155"/> prevent Reflection and Envy, they order'd that one of 'em should have the Axes, and the other the Rods carried before 'em. In the mean time a great Conspiracy was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on, in order to restore <hi>Tarquinius;</hi> but <hi>Vindicius,</hi> a Servant, detected it, and <hi>Brutus</hi> beheaded <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Tiberius,</hi> his own Sons, as being concern'd in the same; and left the other Complices to be punish'd by his Collegue, whose Relations they were.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Tarquinius</hi> seem'd to be a little too favourable to these other Conspirators, whereupon <hi>Publius Valerius</hi> took care to have 'em punish'd; and the Consul himself was outted of his Place and banish'd, either by reason of his Clemency, or because they suspected him upon the account of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. This <hi>Cicero,</hi> a Bigott for <hi>Democracy,</hi> defends, as being a just and fair Sentence, and conducive to the good of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in extinguishing at once the Monarchy and the Memory of the <hi>Tarquinii.</hi> But S. <hi>Augustin</hi> says, <hi>Tarquinius</hi> was a Good and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Man, and that his Banishment was Unjustifiable.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Tarquinius</hi>'s Place was fill'd by <hi>Valerius,</hi> a Man that hated the King mortally. The Consuls expos'd the King's Goods, to be Plunder'd of the People, and levell'd his Houses with the ground, and restor'd to the publick the <hi>Campus Martius,</hi> which he had engross'd. The King finding that his <hi>Embassies</hi> and <hi>Stratagems</hi> were successless,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:136207:155"/> marches against the Rebels at the head of a numerous Army of <hi>Etrurians,</hi> and came to a sharp Engagement, in which <hi>Aruns,</hi> his Son, and <hi>Brutus,</hi> were mutually kill'd in a particular Duel. But the <hi>Romans</hi> carried the Victory, and <hi>Valerius</hi> return'd in Triumph to <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. The People were angry with <hi>Valerius,</hi> for governing the Republick by himself with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Collegue, and for making such pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous Processions from his Stately and Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly House, as seem'd to threaten their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. Whereupon <hi>Valerius</hi> pull'd down his House, remov'd the Axes from being a part of his Ensigns, came into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Council and lower'd the Badges to the People; and after he had done many things on the behalf of the Commons, and laid the Foundation of a Democratical Government, allow'd any Man to put in for the Consulship, that pleas'd. He brought in appeals from the Consuls to the People; and made a Law prohibiting any Man, upon pain of Death, to invade the Magistracy, without the desire of the People. He reliev'd the poor, by making abatements of their Taxes. He made another Law for punishing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacy of Consuls; he added 164 Members to the Senate, and gave every one free li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to kill any man that affected Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, providing the Crime cou'd be made to appear. And in regard that the People were to furnish the Charges of Wars, he
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:136207:156"/> appointed two under the title of <hi>Quaestores</hi> to manage the Treasury.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. They were call'd <hi>Quaestores à Quaerendo,</hi> because they enquir'd into the publick Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts and Misdemeanours. Some date their Original yet higher, and alledge, that both <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Numa</hi> had their <hi>Quaestores.</hi> But if it was so, it would seem their Office was only to punish Criminals (as that of the <hi>Triumviri,</hi> who were afterwards appointed to inspect into Capital Affairs) and that after the Cessation of Kings they were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to take care of the Treasury, the riches of the Publick being then more enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. At first there were two for the Town, call'd <hi>Ʋrbani;</hi> but afterwards their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber encreas'd as the Dominions of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire were inlarg'd, insomuch that <hi>Caesar</hi> made 40 Treasurers. Their business was to Collect and Dispose of the Publick Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, to keep the Gold and Silver Ensigns for War, to sell the spoil, and to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Embassadors upon the Publick Charge.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>Augustus</hi> gave 'em likewise the charge of the Acts of the Senate. The Princes had Treasurers of their own, who were called <hi>Candidati</hi> or <hi>Quaestores Principis,</hi> from whom the <hi>Quaestores Palatii</hi> derive their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal, who were the keepers (as it were) or managers of the Laws, and are now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days call'd Chancellors. As for the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury it self, the Temple of <hi>Saturn</hi> was at first appointed for keeping the Publick Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, together with the <hi>Libri Elephantini,</hi>
                        <pb n="309" facs="tcp:136207:156"/> in which the 35 Tribes, and the Acts of the Senate were engross'd. But the <hi>Libri Lintei,</hi> or the <hi>Annals,</hi> were committed to the care of the <hi>Pontifices.</hi> Afterwards the Treasury was call'd <hi>Fiscus</hi> from the <hi>Fiscelli,</hi> and <hi>Adrian</hi> erected the first <hi>Advocatus Fisci.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9. This done, <hi>Lucretius,</hi> the Father of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretia,</hi> succeeded <hi>Brutus;</hi> but he died after a few days, and <hi>Marcus Horatius</hi> succeeded. <hi>Horatius</hi> consecrated the Capitol on the 13 of <hi>Sept.</hi> it being then finish'd, and his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legue being absent. In his Consulship the first League was made between the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> The next year, <hi>Valeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> who was sirnam'd <hi>Poplicola,</hi> from court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the People, being then a second time Consul, along with <hi>Titus Lucretius Tricipiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus; Porsena,</hi> King of <hi>Clusium,</hi> besieg'd <hi>Rome</hi> with a numerous Army, in order to restore <hi>Tarquinius.</hi> Both the Consuls were woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in some slight Skirmishes, and the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trurians</hi> were pursuing the <hi>Romans</hi> upon the Bridge, when <hi>Horatius Cocles</hi> oppos'd the Crowds of his Enemies till the Bridge was cut down behind him, and then fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the River, and swimm'd out to his own Men.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>Poplicola</hi> and <hi>M. Horatius Pulvillus</hi> being Consuls for the next year, routed <hi>Porsenna</hi> in a bloody Battle, in which he lost 5000 men. But the honour of making an end of the War was truly due to <hi>Mutius Cordus,</hi> who having put on an <hi>Etrurian</hi> habit,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:136207:157"/> design'd to have stabb'd the King with a Dagger, but unluckily kill'd the Clerk in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of his master, whereupon he put his hand into a burning fire before them all. The King was so astonish'd at his Courage, having heard at the same time that 300 more had combin'd to kill him, that he not only pardon'd the Crime, but made Peace with the <hi>Romans,</hi> broke up the Siege, and refresh'd 'em with plenty of all necessaries.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. The War with the <hi>Sabines,</hi> who had plunder'd the <hi>Roman</hi> grounds, commenc'd in the 250 year after the building of the City, the 5 after the expelling of <hi>Tarqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> the 1 of the 69 Olympiad, in which <hi>Ischomachus</hi> was victor, in the Archonship of <hi>Acestoris,</hi> in the 18 year of <hi>Darius</hi> the Son of <hi>Hystaspes,</hi> A. M. 3501. <hi>M. Valerius,</hi> brother to <hi>Poplicola,</hi> and <hi>P. Posthumius Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus</hi> being then Consuls. <hi>Valerius</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd 'em twice in two sharp Engagements; and next year <hi>Poplicola</hi> being Consul a fourth time treated 'em at the same rate, notwithstanding that the <hi>Latines</hi> were join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with 'em. After that, <hi>Poplicola,</hi> the dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Commons, died, and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terr'd upon the Publick Charges, within an Enclosure that was appropriated only to him and his Posterity. But none of 'em would make use of their right, for the Corps were no sooner brought to the <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> and the fire put under, but the dead Person was carried off and buried out of Town.</p>

                        <pb n="311" facs="tcp:136207:157"/>12. In the heat of the War, <hi>Actius Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> the Greatest of all the <hi>Sabinean</hi> Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, came to <hi>Rome</hi> with 5000 Families, after he had employ'd his interest with his Countrymen, to disswade 'em from the War, but could not prevail. This Man was the original of the Illustrious Family of the <hi>Clausii</hi> or <hi>Claudii.</hi> In the same year that <hi>Poplicola</hi> died, the <hi>Sabines</hi> came up to the very Walls, and <hi>Posthumius</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul, who oppos'd 'em, lost a great number of his Men. But afterwards the two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls joyn'd their Forces, and carried an ample Victory, which would have ended in cutting off the whole Army of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, had not the night interpos'd.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. Honours were decreed for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls, upon the Account of their Noble At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements: <hi>Memenius</hi> indeed had a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, but <hi>Posthumius</hi> had only an <hi>Ovatio,</hi> by reason of a defeat he had lately under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone. Now <hi>Festus</hi> derives the word <hi>Ovatio</hi> from the letter <hi>O,</hi> which the Soldiers us'd to redouble upon that occasion: But <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> derives it from the Corruption of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vastes</hi> the Greek Word. It differ'd from a Triumph in this, that the General entered the City at the head of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my on foot, and not on Horseback; that he had only a Purple Gown upon him, but not a Garment, with Bars of Gold; that he had a Lawrel upon his head, but no Scepter in his hand; and if the War was either not declar'd, or put up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:136207:158"/> Blood, he was Crown'd with Myrtles. Next year the <hi>Sabines</hi> being routed again, desir'd a Peace. <hi>Camarina</hi> was likewise ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and levell'd with the ground.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. In the 1 year of the 70 Olympiad, in which <hi>Nicaeas Opuntius</hi> was Victor, in the Archonship of <hi>Myrus,</hi> and the Consulship of <hi>Posthumius Cominius</hi> and <hi>Titus Largius,</hi> or rather <hi>Lartius,</hi> did 30 <hi>Latin</hi> Cities conspire against the <hi>Romans,</hi> upon the sollicitation of <hi>Manilius Octavius,</hi> Son-in-Law to King <hi>Tarquin.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> thought fit to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure themselves by besieging and taking <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denae;</hi> which provok'd the <hi>Latines</hi> to engage more readily in the War. At the same time the <hi>Romans</hi> were troubled with Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at home, occasion'd by the hard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of poor Debtors, whom their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors treated as slaves.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. In the midst of these Commotions, several were debauch'd by Bribes, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in a Conspiracy for the King's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storation. Notwithstanding that a timely discovery was made, and the Criminals punish'd, yet when they offer'd to levy Men for the Army, there were but very few that would list themselves in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Now there was no remedying of this inconvenience, by reason of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals to the People that <hi>Poplicola</hi> erected: Upon which account a new Magistrate was created who had an absolute and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouled Power for six months.</p>
                     <p n="16">
                        <pb n="313" facs="tcp:136207:158"/>16. This head Magistrate was call'd <hi>Dictator,</hi> either because he was <hi>Dictus,</hi> or nominated, by the Consul; or because he <hi>dictated</hi> and gave the word of Command. He was nominated by the Consul by the Senate's orders, without the Consent of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, for carrying on a War, fastening a nail for a memorial in the time of a Plague, calling the <hi>Comitia Consularia,</hi> celebrating Games, choosing Senator's, or upon any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther important occasion. Upon the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the <hi>Dictator,</hi> the Power of all the other Magistrates, bating the Tribunes, was superseded. He nominated one of a Consular or Praetorian Dignity to be <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister Equitum,</hi> with an equal power over the <hi>Equites</hi> and <hi>Accensi.</hi> The Dictator him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self had a full power over the People, and therefore was called <hi>Magister Populi:</hi> And all the other inferiour Officers were call'd <hi>Magistratus</hi> and not <hi>Magistri,</hi> much after the same manner as <hi>Varro</hi> derives <hi>Albatus</hi> from <hi>Albus.</hi> But afterwards Appeals were brought in from him to the People.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. <hi>T. Largius</hi> was the first <hi>Dictator,</hi> and <hi>Sp. Cassius, Magister Equitum.</hi> The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator frighted the People with his Maces and Axes, and having survey'd the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, rais'd a most numerous Army, which he led into the Field, and then made a Truce with the Enemy for one year. This done, the <hi>Latines</hi> took up Arms once more, upon the sollicitation of <hi>Tarquinius</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nilius;</hi> but were sadly routed by <hi>Aulus Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humius,</hi>
                        <pb n="314" facs="tcp:136207:159"/> the second Dictator, at the Lake <hi>Rhegillus,</hi> whereupon they desir'd a Peace, and with difficulty obtain'd it. At last <hi>Tarquinius</hi> having lost all, and being aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd by the <hi>Latines, Etrurians,</hi> and other free Cities, went to <hi>Cuma,</hi> to the Court of <hi>Aristodemus</hi> the Tyrant, where he died soon after, in the 90 year of his Age.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. The <hi>Romans</hi> being freed from War, fell in with new disorders occasion'd by the Exactions of Creditors, and the cries of the Poor, who said they were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pay. This gave rise to such heats, that the <hi>Plebeians</hi> refus'd to take the Oath against the <hi>Sabines,</hi> and threaten'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquish their Country. And tho' at last they suffer'd themselves to be led out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Enemy, yet finding they had got no relief, they return'd home; and tho' the obligation of their Oath mov'd 'em not to flie from their Colours, yet they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd in their Arms to the Sacred Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Then the Town was in a great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation, and the Senators were divided in their sentiments. At last, when they saw that a great number of Deserters went off to the Army, <hi>Menenius Agrippa</hi> prevail'd so far, that Ambassadors were sent with a power to treat without being accountable to the Senate.</p>
                     <p n="19">19. A promise was made to the <hi>Plebei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> that those who were not able to pay their debts, should be forgiven, and that hereafter things should be manag'd by the
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:136207:159"/> joint consent of the Senate and Commons. Then the People were very chearful and ready to return, when <hi>Sicinius</hi> and <hi>L. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> put it into their heads to ask Magistrates for themselves to protect them, and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate their rights. The Ambassadors find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that a business of the last importance, remitted it to the Senate, where after a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous and hot opposition, the request was granted and solemnly confirm'd by an Act of the Senate. Accordingly the <hi>Comitia Curiata</hi> were call'd, and they elected <hi>L. Junius Brutus</hi> (that being the sirname he desir'd) and <hi>L. Sicinius Bellulus,</hi> to whom they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>C.</hi> and <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>. Licinius</hi> and <hi>Spurius Icilius Ruga.</hi> They enter'd upon their new Office on the 13 of <hi>December,</hi> in the 16 year after the expelling of <hi>Tarquinius,</hi> according to the Computation of <hi>Dionysius Halicarnasseus.</hi>

                     <p n="20">20. These Magistrates (if I may so call 'em) were entituled Tribunes of the People, because they were chosen from among the <hi>Tribunes</hi> or general Officers in the Army. In the 297 year of <hi>Rome,</hi> their number was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged to 10. They were all <hi>Plebeians,</hi> tho' <hi>Livy</hi> excepts two. At first they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested with the power of defending the Commons: And with an incredible mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of boldness, they enlarg'd the power they had received. They put a stop to the Senates Acts, and the Magistrates E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts, in pronouncing only the word <hi>Veto.</hi> Afterwards they were made <hi>Sacro-Sancti,</hi> and took the liberty to call a Senate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:136207:160"/> the People, make Laws, and haul the Magistrates themselves to Prison. The only relief against them was this, that one thwarted another: For their remonstran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces did not avail unless the whole Society consented.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. Turbulent Men being invested with so much Authority rais'd such Disorders and Commotions, that instead of vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting rights, which was the end of their Institution, <hi>Lucan</hi> justly calls 'em <hi>turbantes jura, disturbers of rights. Sylla</hi> cramp'd their Power; but after his death their full Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was fully restor'd by the Laws of <hi>Aurelius Cotta, Pompey</hi> and <hi>Crassus,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued such till the Government came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of Emperors, under whom they had only an empty insignificant name. They had neither the Purple Robe nor Serjeants, nor the Chair of State. They did not enter upon their Office in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the year, neither were they superseded by the nomination of a Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, from whence some have conjectured that they were not Magistrates. Besides the Tribunes of the People, and those of the <hi>Celeres,</hi> there were likewise <hi>Tribuni Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> and <hi>Tribuni Aerarii</hi> in the time of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick. And under the Emperors, <hi>Tribuni Voluptatum, Tribuni Matrimoniorum, Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tariorum, Provinciarum,</hi> and <hi>Scholarum,</hi> of which see <hi>Cassiodorus</hi>'s Epistles.</p>

The Commons obtain'd this further privilege, that two should be chosen out of their number to serve the Tribunes, as it were; <hi>i. e.</hi> to take Cognisance of some Causes, and to take care of the Buildings and Corn. They were first called <hi>Ministri Tribunorum,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Aediles,</hi> from taking care of the <hi>Aedes</hi> or Houses, in which the <hi>Plebiscita</hi> or <hi>Decrees of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> were lodg'd. To these two <hi>Aediles Plebis,</hi> a long time after there were two added from the Noblemen, call'd <hi>Curules,</hi> from the Chair of State that was allow'd 'em. In the 710 year after the building of <hi>Rome, Julius Caesar</hi> added two more from the <hi>Patritii,</hi> call'd <hi>Cereales,</hi> because they took care of the Provisions. Now all these six continued to the time of <hi>Constantine. The</hi> Aediles, says <hi>Cicero, are those who take care of the City, of Provisions, and of solemn Games.</hi> It seems they inspected the Fables before they were Acted, and examin'd other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. After any Victory, the Provisions were deliver'd by the Generals to them, as the Prisoners were to the <hi>Praetor,</hi> and the Money to the <hi>Quaestores.

                        <hi>Marcius,</hi> a Nobleman, that from thence was sirnam'd <hi>Coriolanus.</hi> This year the League with the <hi>Latines</hi> was renew'd, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of their faithfulness, when the <hi>Romans</hi> were harass'd by Domestick Feuds and this War. The Senate decreed that Supplications should be made, and a third fair was added to the two <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> ones, one of which was instituted by <hi>Tarquinius</hi> after the Conquest of <hi>Etruria,</hi> and the other by <hi>Populius</hi> in the time of <hi>Tarquinius</hi>'s Exile. At this time a review was made, and 110000 Heads were assess'd.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. Next year a great Famine prevail'd in the Town which was occasion'd by the late Seditions. That made a heavy stir a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Commons; and the animosities of the Poor cou'd not be pacified, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that a Law was made in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, prohibiting the contradicting of the Tribunes when they harangu'd to the People. Ambassadors were sent to <hi>Sicily</hi> to buy Corn, and when they return'd with a considerable quantity, some were of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that it should be sold to the poor at low rates, others were more harsh and thought it more proper to treat the Common People some what roughly, in regard that idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and too great indulgence had puff'd 'em up. Among those of this opinion, <hi>Marcius Coriolanus</hi> spoke most freely; who was a great Assertor of the dignity of the Noblemen, and was disoblig'd by the refusal he met with in the <hi>Comitia Consularia.</hi> He alledg'd
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:136207:161"/> that they should not only cramp the <hi>Commons</hi> in allowing them no Corn, but likewise abolish the Office of the Tribunes.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. Presently the Tribunes Indited him, and cited him to his Tryal before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. Indeed the Noblemen were very loath to suffer one of their number to be try'd by the Commons, but when the <hi>Tribunes</hi> gave 'em to know that they charg'd him with Affecting a Tyranny, and would make good the charge; he offer'd of his own accord to stand Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. He easily clear'd himself of that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and several Persons, whom he sav'd in the War, gave such loud Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niums of his good Offices, both to them and their Country, that 'twas plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, he would quickly be acquitted.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. The Tribunes finding things in that posture, designed to attack him under-hand, whom they could not openly reach; and accordingly blam'd him for not giving the spoils he took in War to the Treasurer, according to the Injunction of the Laws, nor bringing the Money into the Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but distributing it among the Soldiers. They put such a construction upon his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, as if he design'd to curry favour with the Army, and obtain a Life-guard; And tho' 'twas certain what he did was to secure and encourage the Soldiers, and alleviate the common Calamity, at a time when his Country was sunk under Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Divisions, yet such was the Fury of the People, that of 21 Tribes 11 sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenc'd him to perpetual banishment.</p>
                     <p n="27">
                        <pb n="320" facs="tcp:136207:162"/>27. This was the first time that the Commons pass'd Sentence upon a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman. And after this precedent, the Tribunes kept up the Custom of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigning whom they pleased; and the power of the Commons encreas'd every day, while that of the Senators dwindled apace, till at last the Commons were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Senate, Magistracies and Priesthoods; the Noblemen being induc'd to comply with their demands, partly out of Necessity, and partly from a principle of Prudence. In the mean time <hi>Coriolanus</hi> fled to the <hi>Volsci,</hi> and rais'd a heavy War against his ungrateful Country, and took several Places, insomuch that he threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed utter ruin to it. And no Embassies could prevail with him; till at last he yielded with great difficulty to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession and tears of his Mother and Wife. Then he return'd to <hi>Antium</hi> and was kill'd by <hi>Tullius</hi> his Rival. Thus died a Man that out-strip'd all his Contemporaries in Warlike Glory, but by an unflexible stiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness brought his Country into great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and at last ruin'd himself.</p>
                     <p n="28">28. <hi>Coriolanus</hi> being kill'd, the <hi>Volsci</hi> were oblig'd to sue for Peace, and the <hi>Hernici</hi> were Conquer'd, and obtain'd a League, the Conditions of which were left to the determination of <hi>Cassius,</hi> the General. <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi> allow'd 'em the freedom of the City, and endeavour'd by all means to ingratiate the <hi>Plebs,</hi> in order to make his way for Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny.
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:136207:162"/> He propos'd the <hi>Lex Agraria</hi> for distributing the Lands equally among the People; but the Noblemen joyn'd together and prevented him, and condemn'd him to be thrown headlong over the <hi>Tarpeian</hi> Rock: Which accordingly was done in the 1 year of the 74 Olympiad, in which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stylus</hi> the <hi>Syracusan</hi> was Victor, in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chonship of <hi>Leostratus,</hi> and the 1 year of <hi>Xerxes; Q. Fabius,</hi> and <hi>S. Cornelius</hi> being Consuls.</p>
                     <p n="29">29. After the death of <hi>Cassius,</hi> the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen became higher, but the <hi>Plebians</hi> at the same time encreas'd their boldness. When the War broke out again, the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes assisted those who refus'd to take the Oath; but in order to frustrate their intercession the Consuls translated their Bench to the <hi>Campus Martius,</hi> for without the bounds of the City they could assist none. Then they came to fifty blows and heavy threats; and a Dictator was nominated to appease the Commotion, namely, <hi>Sp. Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi> who in some measure alleviated their Domestick Evils by making Consuls that were acceptable both to the Commons and Nobility.</p>
                     <p n="30">30. Next year being the 1 of the 75 Olympiad, in which <hi>Xerxes</hi> cross'd over to <hi>Greece, Callias</hi> being Archon, and <hi>Caeso Fabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and <hi>Sp. Furius,</hi> the former the second time, and the latter the first time Consul, did the <hi>Aequi</hi> and <hi>Veientes</hi> rise up in Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the People of <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Veientes</hi>
                        <pb n="322" facs="tcp:136207:163"/> induc'd all <hi>Hetruria</hi> to rebel, and defeated the Consuls oftner than once; making Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions even to the City. Then the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate thought it necessary to secure their Territories by Garrisons: But at the same time the Treasury was exhausted, and the Taxes were not equal to the publick Charges; besides 'twas not to be expected that many would voluntarily list themselves in service for so tedious a War. Things being at this pass, the Consul mov'd that the whole concern should be committed to the care of the Family of the <hi>Fabii;</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly these accepted the Commission, and fortified <hi>Cremera</hi> a Castle upon the out-lying Territories.</p>
                     <p n="31">31. The <hi>Veientes</hi> being beaten had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a Peace: But now they reviv'd the War, and cut off all the <hi>Fabii,</hi> to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 306. The story goes that all the Family and Kindred was cut off, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one young Boy, who surviv'd that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saster, and propagated the desolate Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: But <hi>Dionysius</hi> plainly proves that to be false. Authors are divided upon the time of this defeat. <hi>Macrobius</hi> says it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd on the 16 of <hi>July; Plutarch</hi> says it happen'd after the Summer Solstice, in the month of <hi>Quintilis,</hi> about the New moon; <hi>Livius</hi> and <hi>Tacitus</hi> assign the 18 of <hi>July,</hi> and <hi>Ovid</hi> casts it on the 13 of <hi>February.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="323" facs="tcp:136207:163"/>32. After the overthrow of the <hi>Fabii,</hi> the <hi>Veientes</hi> were much animated, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrated to the <hi>Janiculum:</hi> but in a year or two's time were so often defeated, that they again desir'd a Peace. This War was but a slight one in comparison to the Civil Wars. The City was in great want of Provisions, by reason that in the preceeding year while the <hi>Veientes</hi> besieg'd the <hi>Capitol,</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> could neither ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure the ground nor keep up any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. This gave occasion to great tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults. <hi>Genutius,</hi> Tribune of the Commons, made a heavy stir about the <hi>Lex Agraria,</hi> and <hi>Volero,</hi> his Successor, propos'd another Law, enjoyning the Tribunes to be created in the <hi>Comitia Tributa.</hi> Now the <hi>Comitia Tributa</hi> differ'd from the <hi>Curiata,</hi> in this, that in these the <hi>Curiae</hi> or Wards only confirmed what the Senate had luckily Enacted; but in those, every thing was transacted without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention of any decree of the Senate, merely by the separate Votes of the <hi>Tribes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="33">33. The States had a heavy debate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the making of this Law. The Noblemen were mightily offended by the impudence of the Tribune; and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment was further inflam'd, in regard that he requir'd the <hi>Aediles</hi> should like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be nominated by the <hi>Comitia Tributa,</hi> and that all things relating to <hi>Plebeians,</hi> should be transacted there. Now the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen tendency of this was to transfer the
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:136207:164"/> whole Power from the Senate to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>Appius,</hi> the Consul, was one of the chief opposers; the temper of his Family was always against the <hi>Plebs;</hi> he interlin'd his publick harangues with all manner of railing and opprobrious Invectives: and by that means put all again in confusion, when his Collegue <hi>Quintius</hi> had by his meek and smooth discourses almost compos'd the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences. The <hi>Tribunes</hi> order'd the <hi>Consul</hi> to be Imprison'd, but the <hi>Patritii</hi> stood by him, and at last they came to fifty cuffs and throwing of stones, in a scandalous manner.</p>
                     <p n="34">34. <hi>Quintius,</hi> who was all for moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, got the <hi>Tribunes</hi> to consent that the matter should be remitted to the Senates determination, the People being then pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssess'd of the Capitol, where they kept a guard night and day. The Senate ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd of the Law, and the <hi>Comitia</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd it: Whereupon the Consuls marched out at the head of their Armies, <hi>Quintius</hi> against the <hi>Aequi,</hi> and <hi>Appius</hi> against the <hi>Volsci.</hi> Each of the Consuls met with such success as they deserv'd. For <hi>Quintius</hi>'s Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was prompted by the Consideration of his equity and mildness, to obey him in every thing; and did of their own accord undergo several hazards, in order to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase Glory and Honour to their General. But <hi>Appius</hi>'s Army hated him, and were on purpose lazy; and when they were drawn out into the Field, refused to engage, and
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:136207:164"/> loudly demanded to march out of their Enemy's Country.</p>
                     <p n="35">35. <hi>Appius</hi> being oblig'd to take his Men out of the Enemy's Country, before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to his own, exercis'd the utmost se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities upon the disobedient. For the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turions,</hi> whose Companies had fled, and the Standard bearers that had lost their Standards, were either beheaded or whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to death. And as for the rest, every tenth Man in the Army was drawn out by Lot, and put to death. That being the usual way among the <hi>Romans,</hi> of punishing Deserters, and those who lost or threw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Standards.</p>
                     <p n="36">36. Next year the Senate went upon the <hi>Lex Agraria,</hi> which the Consuls and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes laid before them. But <hi>Appius</hi> being against it, wheedled almost all the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to side with him. Whereupon the Tribunes cited him to stand tryal for his Life. The <hi>Patritii</hi> were ready to employ their interest for saving the Criminal, and intreated <hi>Appius</hi> to humour the times, and take upon him a habit more suitable to his present Circumstances. But <hi>Appius</hi> said he would not condescend to any thing that was sordid or below his Dignity. He did not abate any thing of his wonted Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity; and when he saw that the whole City expected his Condemnation, laid vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hands on himself, a few days before the Tryal. Notwithstanding the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strances of the Tribunes, the People al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:136207:165"/> his Son to have a Funeral Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick upon his Father, according to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom of their Ancestors.</p>
                     <p n="37">37. The <hi>Romans</hi> fought successively for some years against the <hi>Aequi, Sabini</hi> and <hi>Volsci.</hi> But in the 80 Olympiad, in which <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rymbas</hi> the <hi>Thessalian</hi> was Victor, <hi>Phrasides</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then Archon, and <hi>P. Volumnius</hi> and <hi>Ser. Sulspicius Camerinus</hi> Consuls; The Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes made a new stir among the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, by suggesting to them, that in a free State that was the best form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that gave equal liberty to every Man to speak and give his opinion, and propos'd that the Administration of all things, both private and publick, should be regulated by positive Laws: Designing by such motions to effect what <hi>C. Terentius,</hi> Tribune of the People, had offer'd at in the preceding year. Accordingly, without the consent of the Senate, they made a Law, ordering that ten Men, recommended by their Age and Prudence, should be chosen by the People in their <hi>Comitia,</hi> to publish written Laws upon all publick and private Affairs; that their Laws should be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd in the Forum; and that both the yearly Magistrates and the private Citizens should take the decisions of their mutual differences from them.</p>
                     <p n="38">38. The <hi>Patritii</hi> would not suffer Laws to be made without a Decree of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to that effect; whereupon they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play'd all their force in hindering the
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:136207:165"/> meeting of the <hi>Comitia;</hi> and among other young Noblemen, one <hi>Caeso Quintius,</hi> Son to <hi>L. Quintius Cincinnatus,</hi> made a great figure. He spar'd no opprobious Invectives in railing against the <hi>Plebeians,</hi> and was thereupon Indicted by the Tribunes. His Father defended him but sorrily, for the Tribunes foreseeing that the boldness of Insolent youths would grow to an unsuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable heighth, if he got off with impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, arraign'd him of a feign'd Crime; the Tryal being put off he got out upon Bail, and fled from his Bail to <hi>Tuscany,</hi> but the Tribunes oblig'd the Bail to pay the Money they had engag'd for. The Father sold most of his Estate and Goods, and pay'd to the Bail the Money they had laid out for his Son, and retir'd with a few Servants to the Country, to a little Farm that was all he had sav'd of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, upon which he had a little sorry Cottage, and there manur'd the Land in a laborious and miserable condition. Grief and Want oblig'd him neither to see the City nor to entertain his Friends, nor ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate Festival days, nor to be present at any publick Solemnity.</p>
                     <p n="39">39. However the Tribunes were very much disappointed; for <hi>Caeso</hi>'s distress was so far from checking the insolence of the young men, that they became more inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and haughty, and oppos'd the Law both in words and deeds. The Tribunes seeing they could not get the Law to bear,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:136207:166"/> made a noise of a great Conspiracy against the Commons; but <hi>Claudius,</hi> the Consul, made it appear to be a Fiction. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick Evils were further enflam'd by one <hi>Herdonius Sabinus,</hi> who at the had of 4000 men possess'd himself of the Capitol, and invited the Servants to take their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The Tribunes would not suffer the disorder to be redress'd, till <hi>Valerius</hi> one of the Consuls, bound himself by an Oath to satisfie the demands of the <hi>Plebeians. Valerius</hi> was kill'd in the Siege of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitol, and <hi>Claudius</hi> would not rest till <hi>L. Quintius,</hi> Father of the banish'd <hi>Caeso,</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the deceas'd Consul.</p>
                     <p n="40">40. 'Twas with difficulty that <hi>L. Quintius Cincinnatus</hi> was induc'd to part from his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try retreat; however he at length accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Post, and by his Authority re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd the Sedition, and oblig'd the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple wonderfully by his Equity and Justice. Next year he was created Dictator, to make head against the <hi>Aequi,</hi> who were possess'd of <hi>Tusculum,</hi> and within sixteen days after his entry upon that Post, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd the Consul's Camp from a siege, defeated a gallant Army of the Enemies, demolish'd their City and left a Garrison in it, and return'd in Triumph to <hi>Rome,</hi> with the Enemy's General and several great Men bound in Chains. Then he dimitted his Magistracy, and refus'd all the honours proffer'd him by the Senate, and retir'd again to his Country Seat. Thus did he
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:136207:166"/> prefer a laborious Life to that of a Prince, and was prouder of his poverty than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are of their riches.</p>
                     <p n="41">41. Next year the <hi>Plebeians</hi> refus'd to fight against the <hi>Sabines</hi> and <hi>Aequi,</hi> unless the number of the Tribunes were enlarg'd to that of ten; which accordingly was granted. But even that did not satisfie them, for the Tribunes made a new stir by encroaching on the Authority of the Consuls for the next year. For whereas formerly the Tribunes were only allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to harangue to the People, but did not pretend to call the Senate, or give their own Votes; that honour being peculiar to the Consuls; yet one <hi>Icilius,</hi> an Active and Eloquent Man, induc'd the Tribunes for that year to call a Senate. <hi>Icilius</hi> likewise mov'd, that the <hi>Aventine</hi> Hill, which was no less than 22 Furlongs in Circumference, and belong'd to the Publick, together with the Wood which grew very plentifully up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, should be given to the <hi>Plebs</hi> to build Houses upon.</p>
                     <p n="42">42. The Tribune desir'd that his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should be confirm'd by a Decree of the Senate; and finding that the Consuls put it off, order d an Officer to follow them to the College and call a Senate, and was not far from throwing headlong over the Rock one of the Serjeants that repuls'd the Officer, by the Consuls orders. For the Consuls could neither offer violence nor rescue the Serjeant, tho' at the same
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:136207:167"/> time they were highly sensible of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front. Then they implor'd the assistance of the other Tribunes; but they had all combin'd to carry on the design with joynt force. When the Consuls call'd a Senate, <hi>Icilius</hi> appear'd and excus'd all that was done, and made it out that his Law was very useful for preventing the insurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the poor, who were mov'd to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition by the <hi>Patritii,</hi> their encroaching on the publick grounds. So that he got a Decree pass'd on that behalf.</p>
                     <p n="43">43. Tho' these Civil Commotions seem'd to be thus laid asleep, yet next year the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes reviv'd 'em, and then Wars broke out which did not at all injure the Republick; for this was a certain rule, that when they were engag'd in Wars, they were free from Domestick Quarrels, and when they enjoy'd Peace Civil dissensions prevail'd. The Consuls indeed were in the right of it, in proposing that the Mob should be kept under by Foreign Wars; but they were out in using the extremity of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and admitting of no excuse in levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men. Upon this the Tribunes took occasion to raise the <hi>Plebs,</hi> and inveigh'd against he Consuls for ordering <hi>Roman</hi> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens that implor'd relief from the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes to be put in prison. The tumult encreas'd every day till at last they came to blows, and the Consuls were cited to their Tryal; for the Tribunes cry'd that not only their Authority was infring'd,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:136207:167"/> but their sacred persons affronted and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</p>
                     <p n="44">44. The People were so furious and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to Civil Wars, that if the Tribunes had propos'd any thing against the Consuls or the Senate, the City had certainly ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it self: But at last the Tribunes call'd together the People, and told 'em that out of respect to several good and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Men, they forgave the Affront given to themselves, but would prosecute and revenge the injury done to the People, and promis'd to promote the <hi>Lex Agraria,</hi> which had lain by above 30 years. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many who egg'd on the People in their Convention, none made more noise than <hi>L. Siccius Dentatus,</hi> a Man of a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Aspect, and 58 years of Age, who by recounting a great many Exploits done by him, put the People in such a ferment that they would not so much as hear those who offer'd to speak against him.</p>
                     <p n="45">45. This man had serv'd in all Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Posts, and receiv'd all the degrees of Honour in that Capacity. He was strong to a Miracle, and in the time of 40 years continual service had fought in 120 En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements. He had 45 Wounds upon the fore-part of his body, but none on the hinder; and 12 of those were receiv'd that day that <hi>Herdinius Sabinus</hi> took the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol. From the several Battels he had been in, he got several badges of honour. He had 14 <hi>City Crowns,</hi> which were put upon him

This is <hi>Dionysius</hi>'s List, to which <hi>Gellius</hi> adds ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Siege Crown,</hi> as many Bracelets as make in all 160, 4 Spears, and as many Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses. He calls him <hi>L. Sicinius Dentatus,</hi> and says he was sirnam'd the <hi>Roman A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="46">46. <hi>Siccius</hi> told 'em he had serv'd the Republick in so many great Exploits, but the reward of his labours was anticipated by the Noblemen, who possess'd the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd grounds; and added several other Arguments for making the Law, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting all suggestions to the contrary. The Assembly was presently in such a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that one would have thought they would have run on in a Current; when <hi>Icilius</hi> the Tribune rose, and spoke much to the advantage of <hi>Siccius,</hi> but told 'em 'twas a very unjust thing for any to charge others with Crimes that they themselves were guilty off: And in regard 'twas highly just that every Man should have the liberty of speaking his mind, he adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:136207:168"/> the Convention to another day, on which every man might be in readiness.</p>
                     <p n="47">47. The <hi>Patritii</hi> finding their requests ineffectual, design'd to oppose the Law by open force. They hinder'd the People to meet in their Tribes, took away their pitchers and ballotes, and sparing the Tribunes who made a heavy noise and crowded in among 'em, resisted their followers, and so render'd their Offices of no effect. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong these, the young Gentlemen of the Families of the <hi>Posthumius</hi>'s, <hi>Sempronius</hi>'s and <hi>Claelius</hi>'s, made the greatest stir, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the <hi>Lex Agraria</hi> to be ratify'd by a <hi>Plebiscitum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="48">48. Tho' the Tribunes were mightily enrag'd, yet they resolv'd to Indite none but them, and put up the Quarrel by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming the Estates from the Noblemen, and restoring them to their proper own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. And were just going to ratifie the Law, when the <hi>Aequi</hi> penetrated to the <hi>Tusculum,</hi> and oblig'd the People to drown their Domestick Feuds in a Foreign War. Among others, <hi>Siccius</hi> march'd out against the Enemy, at the head of 800 <hi>Veterans,</hi> who follow'd him by way of Compliment. The Consuls had a mind he should be lost, because the Nobility hated him for the Glory he had purchas'd by his Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Accordingly they employ'd him to attack the Enemy's Camp, in such a manner as would certainly have ended in his ruin. But he storm'd their Camp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:136207:169"/> way, and then return'd to the field of Battle, where he contributed much to the obtaining of the Victory. After all was over he return'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> and laid open the whole story to the People, and procur'd the Consuls so much envy even from the Senators, that when they sought a Triumph, their demands were rejected. And in the next Convention the Commons made <hi>Siccius</hi> Tribune.</p>
                     <p n="49">49. <hi>Siccius</hi> having celebrated the initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory rites on the first day of his Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, endited <hi>T. Romulius</hi> the Consul for the preceding year, before the meeting, before he entred upon any publick Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Romulius</hi> had a haughty speech that was not suited to the occasion, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Tribes Voted against him; and his punishment was a fine of 10000 <hi>Asses,</hi> which <hi>Siccius</hi> had wisely advis'd. A few days after <hi>Venturius</hi> his Collegue was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise fin'd in 15000 <hi>Asses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="50">50. So that the Consuls for this year were sadly afraid that when they laid down their Consulship, the Commons would treat them at the same rate. Upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count they openly favour'd the <hi>Plebeians,</hi> and in the meeting of the Centuries made a Law allowing all Magistrates to fine those who were guilty of any misdemeanor with reference to their Authority, contrary to the Discipline and Laws of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. Now in former times none but the Consuls had that power. However the
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:136207:169"/> measure of the fine was not left to their discretion, but 'twas provided by a Statute that the largest fine should not exceed the value of 2 Oxen and 30 Sheep, and that Law was long observ'd by the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="51">51. Then the Consuls remitted to the Senate the cognisance of the Laws, which the Tribunes labour'd mightily to have writ for the common use of the People, and for a perpetual memorial. In this affair the opinion of <hi>T. Romulius</hi> prevail'd, who alter'd his tune and alledg'd that the Commons should be humour'd: To prevent their amazement at his turning, he said he was as much against 'em as before, but only since matters were come to that pass, that the power of the Nobility did plainly decline, he thought 'twas their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to act conformably to their present Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances. So that he advis'd 'em to send Commissioners, some to the <hi>Grecian</hi> Cities in <hi>Italy,</hi> and some to <hi>Athens,</hi> in order to fetch from thence the best Laws and such as were most suitable to the <hi>Roman</hi> Customs and Statutes. And when they return'd, to leave it to the Senate to nominate Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislators and to determine what should be the extent of their power, and how long it should endure, and, in fine, to do in all the other Circumstances of that affair as they thought fit.</p>
                     <p n="52">
                        <pb n="336" facs="tcp:136207:170"/>52. The greatest part of the Senators approv'd of <hi>Romulius</hi>'s motion. And in pursuance of the same, by vertue of an Act pass'd in the Senate, and ratifi'd by a <hi>Plebiscitum, Sp. Posthumius, Servius Sulpicius,</hi> and <hi>A. Manlius</hi> were made Commissioners for fetching Laws from <hi>Greece;</hi> and were furnish'd upon the publick cost with Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys adorn'd with all the Ensigns of the Greatness of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter three years they return'd, and the Tribunes press'd the Consuls to leave the Affair of the Laws to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. But the Consuls being unwilling to sink the power of the Nobility, put it off till the <hi>Comitia,</hi> in which they chose <hi>App. Claudius</hi> and <hi>T. Gentius</hi> Consuls, much sooner than usually. And then laid aside all care of the publick, as being thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to others, and gave no ear to the Tribunes, meaning to pass the rest of their Consulship without doing any thing.</p>
                     <p n="53">53. The Tribunes being oblig'd to have recourse to the Consuls elect, inveigled <hi>Appius</hi> by the promises of new honours to side with the <hi>Plebeians. Appius</hi> brought his Collegue to be of the same side, and did so egg on the people with his harangues, that <hi>P. Sestius</hi> the Consul was oblig'd to call a Senate by himself, and remit the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of the Laws to the Senate, for his Collegue <hi>L. Menenius</hi> was then a dying. <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> the Consul elect, being first ask'd, according to the custom, gave his
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:136207:170"/> opinion, that ten men of the noblest rank of Senators should be chosen, and invested with an annual Authority, as being entit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Administration of Affairs, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Consular Authority, which the Kings had formerly; and that all other Magistrates should be broke till they were restor'd again by the Laws; and that these <hi>Decemviri</hi> should take cognisance of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate contracts, and manage the publick Affairs. This was the opinion of the two elected Consuls; and was carried.</p>
                     <p n="54">54. When the day of <hi>Comitia</hi> came, the 2 elected Consuls resign'd their Consulship; and then the people cry'd 'em up, and elected them first, to whom they added <hi>P. Sestius</hi> Consul for that year, and the 3 Commissioners <hi>P. Posthumius, Servius Sulpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and <hi>A. Manlius,</hi> together with <hi>T. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulius,</hi> who was the proposer of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular opinion, notwithstanding that the Commons had cast him before, besides <hi>C. Julius, T. Veturius</hi> and <hi>P. Horatius,</hi> in whose room <hi>Livy</hi> puts <hi>P. Curiatius:</hi> These were all Senators and of the Consular dignity. And then the Tribunes, Aediles and Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stores, and all other Magistrates were broke.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. THE second transformation of the Government of <hi>Rome,</hi> happen'd on the 15 of <hi>May,</hi> in the 302 year after the building of the City, according to <hi>Cato's</hi> Calculation, but in the 307 according to <hi>Tarrutius</hi> and <hi>Varro,</hi> which happen'd to be the 2 and 3 of the 82 Olympiad, the 14 of <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus,</hi> the 449 before the Birth of Christ, A.

                     <p n="2">2. The Mace and Consular Ensigns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to one of the <hi>Decemviri,</hi> who call'd together the Senators, ratify'd the Decrees, and perform'd all the other offices belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the head Magistrate. The rest, to prevent Envy, were cloath'd much like the other Citizens, and had only an usher to walk before 'em. After a certain number of days every one succeeded to the place of head Magistrate by turns. They gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:136207:171"/> the Republick with Justice and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and set up the Laws in ten Tables upon the most Conspicuous part of the <hi>Forum. Dionysius</hi> says they were engraven on Brass, but <hi>Pomponius Ictus</hi> says 'twas up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Ivory. So did <hi>Minos</hi> in ancient times, and long after him, <hi>Solon</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> write their Laws upon Tables, which were call'd <hi>Cyrbes</hi> and <hi>Axones.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. Next year something seem'd to be yet wanting, especially that the power of the Tribunes, which gall'd the Senators so much, should be abrogated. With which view the Senators mov'd that the <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viri</hi> should be created again, and carried it. The Commons chearfully consented to the motion, being seduc'd by the dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Appius,</hi> who bore the credit of the whole Administration, and gain'd the People by his Complaisance and fair speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and other Offices. The People were mightily for his continuing in the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy, and he seem'd with difficulty to comply with their requests; and then was openly partial to his Friends, and inveigh'd against every body else. However, he was again made <hi>Decemvir</hi> in the <hi>Comitia Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turiata,</hi> and with him <hi>Q. Fabius Vibulanus, M. Cornelius, M. Servilius, L. Minutius, T. Antonius, Manius Rabulejus,</hi> all Noblemen; together with <hi>Q. Petilius, Caeso Duillius,</hi> and <hi>Sp. Oppius, Plebeians,</hi> whom <hi>Appius</hi> took in, in order to ingratiate himself with the People.</p>
                     <p n="4">
                        <pb n="340" facs="tcp:136207:172"/>4. <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> and his Collegues re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the Consular power on the 15 of <hi>May,</hi> but at that time the months were calculated by the course of the Moon, and the full Moon happen'd on that very day. They enter'd into a private Conspiracy, to keep the Government for ever to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, matters being so order'd, that all of 'em should be equal in dignity and power, that whatever one liked should be ratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and confirmed by all the rest; that the Acts of the Senate and those of the <hi>Plebs</hi> should never be made use of without a pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing occasion; and that most things should be manag'd by the Authority of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. These <hi>Decemviri</hi> added two other Tables of the Laws to the former ten, and the whole number together were call'd <hi>leges duodecim tabularum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Decemviri manag'd all by force, and fill'd the City with Blood and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine. They continued their power next year and either kill'd or banish'd most of the richer Citizens. The <hi>Sabines</hi> and the <hi>Aequi</hi> made use of this opportunity to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> grounds; and the Decemviri being engag'd in the War against 'em, were guilty of those Crimes which brought their Tyranny to an end; for <hi>Appius,</hi> who staid in Town, finding that <hi>Siccius Dentatus,</hi> that <hi>Roman Achilles,</hi> kept a narrow eye upon the Estate of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, sent him to the Camp in the Quality of a Legate, and perfidiously sent
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:136207:172"/> secret Intelligence to his Collegues to kill him. Then he fell in Love with the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>L. Virginius,</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Citizen, and in order to enjoy her, adjudg'd her to be the Servant of one of his Tenants. But the Father foreseeing that his Daughter was about to be expos'd to the Tyrant's Lust, cut her throat with a knife, and went straight to the Camp, where he induc'd the Army to revolt.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. By this means the <hi>Decemviri</hi> came to be outted by the Senate, for the Army de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd for it and the Republick. And the Consulship fell to <hi>Valerius Potitus</hi> and <hi>M. Horatius,</hi> who were very much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to the Commons, as it appear'd by the Laws they made. One of which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that Laws enacted in the <hi>Comitia Tributa,</hi> should be universal, and have the same power with those made by the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitia Centuriata.</hi> Now in the <hi>Tributa</hi> the Noblemen were out-voted by the <hi>Plebei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and poor Members; but in the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turiata</hi> the former always prevail'd, tho' the latter were much superior in number. A Capital punishment and the forfeiture of Estates, was provided against those who should offer to violate or abrogate that Law.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Virginius</hi> Tribune of the People In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted <hi>Appius,</hi> and others did the same to the other <hi>Decemviri.</hi> But <hi>Appius</hi> either murder'd himself, or was kill'd by the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes, in Prison, before the tryal. <hi>Oppius</hi>
                        <pb n="342" facs="tcp:136207:173"/> likewise laid violent hands on himself; the other 8 were banish'd, and <hi>Claudius</hi> who laid claim to <hi>Virginia</hi> as his Servant, was likewise sentenc'd to perpetual banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. All the rest who serv'd the <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viri</hi> in their unjust designs were pardon'd. Then the Consuls fought successively a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Aequi, Volsci</hi> and <hi>Sabini;</hi> but when they put in for a Triumph, their demand was rejected by the Senate. The Consuls took the refusal for a heavy Affront, and having call'd a meeting of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, accus'd the Senate in a long harangue, and were back'd by the Tribunes, who pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their Bill, so that the People gave 'em the liberty of a Triumph, and they were that first of all the <hi>Romans</hi> that introduc'd the custom.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. From what has been said, 'tis appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent how the Commons of <hi>Rome</hi> hook'd the Authority into their own hands, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most turn'd the Nobility out of any share in the Goverment. But they were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with that purchase, but the more they satisfied their thirst, the more it was inflam'd; for they now pretended to a share of the Consulship, and when the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui, Sabini, Veientes</hi> and <hi>Ardeates</hi> threaten'd 'em with a heavy War, the Tribunes res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu'd all those whom the Consuls were about to list in the service, and would not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer 'em to punish those who stood out. Nay, they threaten'd to thwart the Senate in every thing else, and to ratifie no act of
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:136207:173"/> the Senate whatsoever, unless the Senate first made an Act in Confirmation of the Law they had promulgated to that effect. But <hi>Claudius,</hi> a Senator, found out a way of satisfying the Ambition of the <hi>Plebei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and at the same time keeping up the dignity of the <hi>Patritii.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9. He perswaded the Senators, when they were reduc'd to necessity, to allow the <hi>Plebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians</hi> a share of the the greatest power and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and for that end to create Magistrates who should be call'd <hi>tribuni militum,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist of as many Noblemen as <hi>Plebeians.</hi> This project was first started privately; then the Tribunes and others hugg'd it, and liberty was given to as many <hi>Plebeians</hi> as pleas'd to put in for the Magistracy along with the <hi>Patritii.</hi> But <hi>Desire</hi> is a thing of so much levity, especially when lodg'd in a Mob, that those very Men who but now were unspeakably eager to be in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy, and, if the Noblemen had not granted their demand, would either have deserted the Town as before, or master'd it by force of Arms: That Crew, I say, when they had compass'd their end, remov'd their desire from what they coveted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and bended it upon a contrary thing.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. For when many of the <hi>Plebeians</hi> put in with all their might for the Office of <hi>tribuni militum;</hi> the Senate thought none of 'em worthy of that Post, and having the Votes in their own power, prefer'd the Noble and Illustrious men that sollicited for
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:136207:174"/> it, namely, <hi>A. Sempronius Atratinus, L. Attilius Longus,</hi> and <hi>T. Claelius Siculus.</hi> These were the first that got the Proconsular dignity, in the 3 year of the 84 Olympiad, according to <hi>Dionysius;</hi> but according to the computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of others in the 1 year of that Olympiad, the 310 after the building of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the 21 of <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus, M. Genutius,</hi> and <hi>C. Quintius,</hi> or <hi>L. Papyrius</hi> and <hi>L. Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pronius,</hi> being then Consuls.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. At first there were 3 <hi>tribuni militum,</hi> afterwards 6 and at last 8. Indeed <hi>Pomponius Jctus</hi> says there was once 20 or above, but either he is mistaken, or the word is corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from <hi>Seni</hi> to <hi>Viceni.</hi> When the number encreas'd and the <hi>Plebeians</hi> crept in among them, tho' they had a Consular power, and were entitled to all the badges of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, yet the Dignity was still reckon'd to be of an inferiour degree, and <hi>Proconsular,</hi> as 'twere. Sometimes they, and sometimes Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls were chosen, till the year 388 after the building of the City, that <hi>Q. Sextius,</hi> a <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beian,</hi> was elected Consul, and so they came into disuse. The first three retain'd their Government only 73 days, by reason of the appearance of some signs. And then the People chose <hi>L. Papyrius Mugalinus,</hi> and <hi>L. Sempronius Atratinus</hi> to be Consuls.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Next year the People likewise thought it fit to elect Consuls; and accordingly <hi>M. Geganius Macerinus,</hi> and <hi>T. Quintius Capitolinus</hi> enter'd upon their Consulship on the 13 of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember;</hi> the former being then twice and the
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:136207:174"/> second five times Consul. In their Consulship the <hi>Censores</hi> were instituted, whose office had been better known, had not the injuries of time rob'd us of a part of <hi>Dionysius Halicar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasseus</hi> his account of the same. The Consuls remonstrated to the Senate, that the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Expeditions of the Consuls occasion'd the neglect of several useful things, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of the valuation of Estates, by which they knew both the number of those who were fit for Military Service, and the proportion of every Man's Estate, by which the publick Taxes were to be adjusted: For there had been no survey or assessment for 17 years, from the Consulship of <hi>L. Cornelius</hi> and <hi>Fabius;</hi> by which means many good and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Men were assess'd and employ'd upon Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions, when the idle and profligate sort were left unminded, and remov'd from one place to another, where they liv'd as they pleas'd.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. Upon which account the Senators e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected two of their Members, whom they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Censores,</hi> either because the People was sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd and assess'd <hi>(census)</hi> by them, as <hi>Varro</hi> will have it; or else because, as <hi>Festus</hi> says, every man's Estate was valu'd according to their Judgment or report <hi>(quanti illi censuis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.)</hi> At first they were created for 5 years, afterwards in the 320 year after the building of <hi>Rome,</hi> the term of their service was redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to a year and a half. At first they only survey'd and assess'd the People; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they were employ'd to inspect into the

In process of time the Censors likewise farm'd the publick Revenues, and took care of the publick Buildings, and the High-Roads, and regulated the charges of the publick Sacrifices. There were also Deputy Censors in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, who sent them an account of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and the estates of the Inhabitants, to be inserted in the publick Tables. After the second <hi>Punick</hi> War, the Censors were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested with a Consular Dignity, and wore the Ensigns of that office, and indeed were reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd a degree better than they.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. In the mean time the <hi>Plebeians</hi> being push'd on by the Tribunes, took it very ill that they were not allow'd inter-marriages with the Nobility, and laid claim to an equal right. This stir'd up <hi>Sp. Maelius</hi> to aspire at the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by distributing Corn in the time of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; but <hi>L. Quintius Cincinnatus</hi> being made <hi>Dictator</hi> in the 80 year of his Age, employ'd <hi>C. Servilius Hala,</hi> Major General of Horse to kill him, and pull down his House, in the 315 year after the building of the City. The Tribunes resented his death, and mov'd that <hi>they should</hi> choose the <hi>tribuni militum</hi> next year, that so the <hi>Plebeians</hi> might then creep into that Post; but they were disappointed. In this
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:136207:175"/> year, <hi>Fidenae</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> Colony surrender'd it self to <hi>Tolumnius,</hi> K. of the <hi>Veientes,</hi> and upon his advice maltraited the <hi>Roman</hi> Legates. Upon the War against them <hi>Mamercus Aemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> was made Dictator, and under his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <hi>Corn.

Fidenae</hi> was soon taken, but revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted again, and the <hi>tribuni militum</hi> were sent to subdue 'em, but being all invested with equal power, and dissenting from one another, they made but an ill hand of it. Whereupon <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milius</hi> was made Dictator a third time, and <hi>Cassus,</hi> Master of the Horse: and these two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated the <hi>Etrurians,</hi> and took <hi>Fidenae.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="16">16. The <hi>Consuls</hi> and <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the Army succeeded mutually, according as the People pleas'd. Soon after the Tribunes got three <hi>Quaestores</hi> and one <hi>Tribunus militum,</hi> chosen out of the Commons. The <hi>Veientes</hi> having perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the <hi>Fidenatians</hi> to revolt, continued still in War with them, and the siege of <hi>Veii</hi> last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 10 years. In the 10 year of that siege <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Camillus</hi> (who had been twice <hi>Tribune</hi> of
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:136207:176"/> the Army, and <hi>Censor</hi>) was chosen <hi>Dictator. Camillus</hi> easily carried <hi>Veii,</hi> and returned to <hi>Rome</hi> in Triumph, riding in a Coach drawn by 4 white Horses, which honour was reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned peculiar to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and he was the first of all the <hi>Romans</hi> that arrogated it to himself. By this action he drew an <hi>odium</hi> upon himself, which was much enflam'd by his hindring the Commons to return to <hi>Veii,</hi> when they sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the Nobility. Upon which the Commons were so incens'd against him that they banish'd him, as if he had cheated the Treasury of the spoil taken in the <hi>Etrurian</hi> War, and fin'd him in 15000 (or rather 1500) <hi>Aera,</hi> which were then only in use among the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="17">17. <hi>Camillus</hi> being banish'd, extended his hands towards the Capitol, and pray'd that if he was injur'd his ungrateful <hi>Countrymen</hi> might have occasion to repent, that it might be seen how much the <hi>Romans</hi> would miss him in his absence. Which happen'd not long after. The <hi>Galli Celtae</hi> being confin'd in too narrow bounds, sent out several Colonies in quest of new seats. The Posterity of those who set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led between the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Mountains and the <hi>Alps,</hi> having tasted the <hi>Italian</hi> Wine, had a mighty itch to subdue the Country that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd such noble liquor; and accordingly cross'd the <hi>Alps,</hi> and remov'd to that part of <hi>Italy,</hi> which the <hi>Hetrusci</hi> were formerly pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd of; and afterwards being call'd <hi>Senones,</hi> came under the Command of their K. <hi>Brennus,</hi> and besieg'd <hi>Clusium,</hi> a City of <hi>Tuscany.</hi> The
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:136207:176"/>
                        <hi>Clusians</hi> implor'd the assistance of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and they sent three Ambassadors all of 'em of the Family of the <hi>Fabius</hi>'s, to bring the Affair to an Accomodation. The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors finding that the <hi>Gauls</hi> could by no means be perswaded into Peace, without they got part of the grounds, were angry and march'd out of the Town to fight. As soon as <hi>Brennus</hi> was inform'd of their motion, he cry'd out, that they violated the Law of Nations, and march'd towards <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="18">18. He demanded that the Ambassadors should be deliver'd up to him, but 'twas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd. This he took for an Affront, and in resentment of the same, defeated the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes of the Army, upon the River <hi>Allia.</hi> Finding <hi>Rome</hi> abandon'd by most of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, he sack'd it, and besieg'd the Capitol. <hi>Camillus</hi> being then at <hi>Veii,</hi> was chosen Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral by the banish'd <hi>Romans:</hi> and being confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by those who kept the Capitol, routed the <hi>Gauls</hi> and put 'em to flight. And thus <hi>Rome,</hi> which had been surpris'd and taken by the <hi>Gauls</hi> on the 15 of <hi>July,</hi> was recover'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain on the 13 of <hi>February,</hi> in the 365 year after the building of the City, and the 16 of <hi>Artaxerxes Mnemon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="19">19. The Tribunes of the People made a noise again about separating and removing to <hi>Veii;</hi> and in order to remedy that evil, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators desir'd <hi>Camillus</hi> to retain the Dictators place for the whole year, tho' that was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precedented. <hi>Camillus</hi> detain'd the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and induc'd 'em to rebuild the City;
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:136207:177"/> which being done in a hurry, it seem'd rather to be a heap of houses one upon another than a regular City; and the Conduits which before were plac'd in the streets were then put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ground. Next year <hi>Camillus</hi> was made Dictator a second time, and Conquer'd the <hi>Aequi</hi> and <hi>Hetrusci,</hi> and oblig'd the <hi>Volsci</hi> to surrender after they had continued the War 70 years.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. Three years after that <hi>Camillus</hi> being made Tribune of the Army defeated 'em a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, as also the <hi>Latines</hi> who had continued true to the <hi>Romans</hi> from the Battel at <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gillum</hi> to that time. These things inflam'd the envy of <hi>M. Manlius</hi> who had purchas'd great glory by defending the Capitol, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged it by liberal Presents to the People, in order to win their Affections, and make his way for Tyranny. But <hi>Corn. Cassus</hi> the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator, or else <hi>Quintius Capitolinus,</hi> who, <hi>Livy</hi> says, was still Major General of the Horse, kill'd him; upon which the Commons were much incens'd.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. Afterwards the War was carired on successfully against the <hi>Latins</hi> and the <hi>Volsci;</hi> but the <hi>Commons</hi> complain'd heavily of the debts. The Tribunes animated 'em, but <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius Ambustus,</hi> a Nobleman, enflam'd their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition much more, for having married one Daughter to a Nobleman, and another to a Commoner, the latter took it ill that she wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the honours that her Sister had, and he made answer that her Family would in time be likewise honourable. He likewise concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:136207:177"/> measures with <hi>Licinius Stolo,</hi> his Son-in-Law, and <hi>L. Sestius,</hi> about giving the <hi>Plebeians</hi> a right to be Consuls. These two men being made Tribunes, rais'd such tumults, that for 5 years there was no head Magistrate. Indeed the Sedition lasted 9 years, and it had come to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother separation, had not <hi>Camillus</hi>'s Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity weigh'd in some measure with both sides. Then <hi>Camillus</hi> was made Dictator a 5th. time, and routed the <hi>Gauls</hi> again, upon the River <hi>Anien.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="22">22. But upon his return to <hi>Rome</hi> he encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd great difficulties, for the <hi>Commons</hi> were up again about the Consulship, and were not far from doing violence to his Person, when dignified by the highest Magistracy, and shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with the Glory of his great Atchievments. So he perswaded the Senators to humour the times, and to make a <hi>Plebeian</hi> one of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls. But at the same time the <hi>Patritii</hi> were allow'd to choose a <hi>Praetor</hi> to judge Causes within the City, out of their own number. Matters being thus accomodated, a Temple was dedicated to <hi>Concord,</hi> which <hi>Camillus</hi> had formerly vow'd. A 4th. day was added to the <hi>Latin-fair,</hi> and the greater games were celebrated, two noblemen being appointed to serve in the room of the <hi>Aediles,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd to execute their office upon that occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and these Noblemen were call'd <hi>Curules</hi> from their Chair of State. Some will have that Chair to be call'd <hi>Curulis</hi> from the Coach upon which it stood; but others derive the occasion from <hi>Cures</hi> a <hi>Sabine</hi> City. The form
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:136207:178"/> of it, as 'tis stamp'd upon medals and Coins, resembles the <hi>Spanish</hi> Chairs, which at this day great men make use of. It had crooked feet, and steps to get up by; and was cover'd with Ivory, with several things Engrav'd upon it.</p>
                     <p n="23">23. The <hi>Praetor</hi> was so call'd <hi>à praeeundo,</hi> and at first the Consuls and most Magistrates went by the same name. The Consuls being for the most part taken up with military business a <hi>Praetor</hi> was appointed to sit as Judge. And about 112 years after the first institution, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the 500 year after the building of <hi>Rome,</hi> another was added, who was call'd <hi>Peregrinus,</hi> from taking cognisance of foreign Causes. Afterwards when <hi>Sardinia, Sicily</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> became Provinces, the number of the <hi>Praetors</hi> was made equal to that of the Provinces, till it came to 18 and above. Afterwards it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd again as the Empire declin'd, and by a Law made by <hi>Valentinianus</hi> and <hi>Marcianus</hi> was reduc'd to three. The Town <hi>Praetor</hi> was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise call'd <hi>Governor,</hi> because in the absence of the Consuls he executed their Office, and took care of the Games, Sacrifices, and decisions of Causes. They had the same badges of honour with the Consul, bating that there were only six rods carry'd before 'em. By reason of their power and dignity and the solemnity of their institution, <hi>Livy</hi> calls 'em Collegues to the Consuls.</p>
                     <p n="24">24. The first <hi>Plebeian</hi> Consul was <hi>L. Sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius:</hi> The first <hi>Praetor</hi> was <hi>Sp. Furius,</hi> Son to <hi>Camillus:</hi> The first <hi>Aediles Curules</hi> were <hi>Cn. Quintius Capitolinus</hi> and <hi>P. Corn. Scipio. L.
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:136207:178"/> Aemilius Mamercus</hi> was Collegue with <hi>Sexti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> for the Nobility. And thus the Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship return'd to its former course after an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval of 23 years; and 'twas then the 88 in number from the Expulsion of the Kings. But the <hi>Tribunes</hi> of the Army were for ever kept out, after they had govern'd the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick 48 times, and the administration of affairs had been 15 times devolv'd from Consuls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and from them upon Consuls. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides these alterations, the Government was toss'd from the Kings to the Consuls, from the Consuls to the <hi>Decemviri,</hi> and from them to the Consuls again, and 20 Dictatorships in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terven'd, besides an infinity of interregnums, during which the Regents govern'd with a Consular power for five days. So many were the changes and alterations that happen'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the banishing of <hi>Tarquinius</hi> their King, in the space of 134 years.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. The Noblemen were so disoblig'd by the <hi>Plebeians</hi> their invading the Consulship, that the Senate made no preparations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Gauls.</hi> The <hi>Plebeians</hi> on the other hand were angry that the Noblemen had 3 Magistracies in their power, and look'd with an envious eye upon the power of the <hi>Praetor.</hi> Whereupon the Commons were allow'd to be capable of the place of <hi>Aedilis Curulis.</hi> Next year a grievous plague rag'd, by which <hi>Camillus</hi> and many others were swept off. And no remedy being found, the Stage Plays were Instituted, and Actors were brought from <hi>Etruria,</hi> who were call'd
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:136207:179"/>
                        <hi>Histri,</hi> from whence the word <hi>Histrio</hi> takes its rise. Soon after <hi>M. Curtius</hi> threw himself head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, at a time that they fought successfully against the <hi>Hernici, Galli, Hetrusci</hi> and <hi>Latini.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="26">26. After the <hi>Plebeians</hi> had enjoyed the Consulship 9 years, the Noblemen taking it ill that <hi>C. Martius Rutilius</hi> had been made Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator in the preceding year, translated him to their rank. And this was so far resented by the Commons that the Nobility was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged both to restore the Consulship, and to pay the debts of the poor out of the Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And in the very next year a <hi>Plebeian</hi> was made one of their Censors.</p>
                     <p n="27">27. Hitherto the <hi>Romans</hi> had not carried their Arms far; but now they began to reach beyond their wonted bounds, being solicited to assist the <hi>Campanians</hi> against the <hi>Samnitians,</hi> whom <hi>Valerius</hi> the Consul defeated and forc'd to make Peace. They likewise made War with the <hi>Latines</hi> for assisting the Enemies of the <hi>Samnitians,</hi> who had thus become their Allies. In this War <hi>Decius. Mus</hi> sacrificed himself for the good of the <hi>Roman</hi> Army, by crouding in amongst the thickest ranks of the Enemies, who cut him to pieces. <hi>T. Manlius</hi> also (who was sirnam'd <hi>Torquatus,</hi> from defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and taking a Chain from a <hi>Gaul</hi> in a Duel) beheaded his own Son for fighting without his Command, notwithstanding that he came off with the Victory. From thence hard precepts were call'd <hi>Manliana;</hi> but when <hi>Manlius</hi> return'd after the defeat of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> the young men would not go out to meet him.</p>

                        <pb n="355" facs="tcp:136207:179"/>18. The Consuls for the next year maul'd the <hi>Latines</hi> again, who had revolted upon the taking of some grounds from them. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate being at that time somewhat unjust to <hi>Aemilius,</hi> one of the Consuls, and desiring to have a Dictator, he nominated <hi>Q. Publius Philo</hi> for his Collegue, whose Magistracy gall'd the Senators sufficiently, especially up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the score of three Laws which he made. The first of which seem'd to alter the whole form of Government, for its tenor was that the <hi>Plebiscita</hi> were obligatory upon the <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites.</hi> The second provided that whatever was enacted by the <hi>Comitia Centuriata</hi> should be propos'd by the Senators. The third ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed one of the Censors at least to be a <hi>Plebeian.</hi> These Laws were made in the 416 year after the building of the City, in the 1 of <hi>Arses</hi> King of <hi>Persia,</hi> and the 23 of <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedonia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="29">29. Next year all <hi>Latium</hi> was subdu'd, and the Ships belonging to the <hi>Antiates</hi> were taken from 'em, the beaks of which were put up in the Church where the harangues were made, from whence it was call'd <hi>Rostra.</hi> Next year after that, <hi>Q. Publius Philo,</hi> a <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beian,</hi> was made Praetor, and the Nobility made but little resistance, having at that time lost all their priviledges and the badges of their dignity. Soon after the <hi>Sidicini</hi> and <hi>Ausones</hi> were Conquer'd and upon a new sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of the Citizens two new Tribes were made, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Metia</hi> and the <hi>Scaptia,</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving new Citizens.</p>

                        <pb n="356" facs="tcp:136207:180"/>30. At the same time 130 Women were convicted of Witch-craft, and put to death; and in regard that was reckon'd a Prodigy, a Dictator was nominated to fasten a nail for a memorial of the same. Then a War broke out with the <hi>Privernates,</hi> who had been push'd on by <hi>Vitruvius Gallus,</hi> a great Man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Faudani.</hi> In the first year they were worsted, in the next <hi>Vitruvius</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and <hi>Privernum</hi> came into the hands of the <hi>Romans. Vitruvius</hi> and his Complices were beheaded; and the other Citizens were allow'd the freedom of the City. Now the first year of this War happen'd to be the last of <hi>Darius Codomannus,</hi> the last of the <hi>Persian</hi> Kings, the 424 after the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Consulship of <hi>L.

At that time, <hi>Bessus</hi> at <hi>Bactra</hi> had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon him the Title of <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> King of <hi>Persia;</hi> whereupon <hi>Alexander</hi> set out, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving passed over the Mountain <hi>Paropamisus,</hi> came to <hi>Bactra,</hi> where <hi>Bessus</hi> was betray'd, and deliver'd into his Hands; and he gave him up to <hi>Oxyartes, Darius</hi>'s Brother, to be Tortur'd to Death.</p>
               <p n="3">3 About this time, he Destroy'd the City of the <hi>Branchidae,</hi> with all the Inhabitants; as a Punishment for the Crime committed by their Ancestors 150 Years before, in giving the Treasure of <hi>Apollo Didymaeus</hi> to <hi>Xerxes</hi> upon his flight, and following him to this Place where they settled. Having passed over the River
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:136207:181"/>
                  <hi>Tamais,</hi> which falls from the Mountain <hi>Cauca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> into the <hi>Caspian-Sea,</hi> he receiv'd a Wound in his Thigh; but after all, the <hi>Scythians</hi> were constrain'd to Surrender themselves by an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassy, and he possess'd himself of <hi>Marcanda,</hi> of which the People of <hi>Sogdiana</hi> had formerly made themselves Masters, by cutting off the <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian</hi> Garrison. At this place, being Drunk with Wine, he kill'd <hi>Clytus,</hi> who had check'd him for slighting the Actions of <hi>Philip</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and with some warmth had spoke of his Glory in a lessening way.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Next Spring, in the beginning of the 10th Year of his Reign, he made himself Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the highest Rock in <hi>Sogdiana,</hi> where <hi>Oxyartes,</hi> (a Lord of that Country) liv'd; whose Daughter <hi>Roxana</hi> he fell so deeply in Love with, that he marry'd her out of hand. Having thus advanc'd the Condition of his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and reduc'd his Enemies, he arrogated to himself divine Honours, which <hi>Callisthenes,</hi> the Philosopher, Son to <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Neece, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused to pay him, and thereupon lost his Head. Afterwards, he march'd towards <hi>India,</hi> and made himself Master of the Hill <hi>Aornos,</hi> which only <hi>Hercules</hi> before him was able to cross.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In the 11th Year of his Reign, which was the 4th after the Death of <hi>Darius,</hi> he passed over the River <hi>Indus,</hi> and invaded <hi>India. Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phis,</hi> or <hi>Mophis,</hi> the King of this Country, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently surrender'd himself, and <hi>Alexander</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd him to go by the name of <hi>Taxiles. Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarus</hi> also, King of the Highlanders, by Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassy surrender'd himself and his Kingdom. Then <hi>Alexander</hi> march'd against <hi>Porus,</hi> who
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:136207:182"/> reign'd beyond the River <hi>Hydaspes.</hi> He cross'd the River without much difficulty; and soon after came to a Battle, in which the <hi>Indian</hi> King was mounted upon an Elephant, and made a terrible Figure; and <hi>Alexander</hi> had his Horse shot, lost many of his Men, and was sav'd by his Officers. <hi>Porus</hi> did not give over fighting till all his Men forsook him. The Conqueror admir'd his Valor, return'd him his Kingdom, and enlarg'd it with the Addition of other Countries. <hi>Alexander</hi> gave Orders for build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two Cities, one call'd <hi>Nicaea,</hi> in the very place where he defeated <hi>Porus;</hi> the other near to the River call'd <hi>Bucephalaea,</hi> in memory of the Horse <hi>Bucephalus,</hi> who dy'd at this place, being 30 Years Old.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Having Conquer'd many Nations, he came to the River <hi>Hyphasis</hi> or <hi>Hyparis,</hi> the utmost limits of his Victories: For he could not by any means persuade his Men to cross it. At this place he order'd the Camp to be made three times larger than usually; he caus'd Beds to be made five Cubits wide; and Mangers, Arms, Bridles, and other Accoutrements of a prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous largeness. He return'd to the River <hi>Hydas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis,</hi> and sail'd towards the Ocean; his Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divided on the two sides of the River. He set out in the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> receiv'd Homage from the <hi>Sibari,</hi> kill'd several others that refus'd to submit, and march'd against <hi>Malli</hi> and <hi>Oxydracae,</hi> with whom he had a bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Battle, that put him in great danger of his Life: For he himself scal'd the Walls of the Castle of <hi>Malli,</hi> and leap'd down on the inside. Whereupon the <hi>Barbarians</hi> shot Darts
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:136207:182"/> at him upon all hands, and he receiv'd a Wound in his Lungs; And by the loss of his Blood and Spirits fell into a swoon, which stopt the Bleeding.</p>
               <p n="7">7. After the recovery of his Wound he sail'd to the place where the Rivers <hi>Hydrao<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

After Ten Months sailing he came to the Island <hi>Pattalena,</hi> where the <hi>Indus</hi> is divided into two Channels: From thence he set forward, and after Encountring several Storms, arriv'd at length in the Ocean, where he sacrific'd Bulls and perform'd other Acts of Devotion to <hi>Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi> in order to procure a happy Voyage to the Fleet, which he order'd <hi>Nearchus</hi> to sail with thro' the Ocean and Persian Bay as far as to <hi>Euphrates</hi> and the <hi>Tigris.</hi> Having left his navy at <hi>Pattala,</hi> he pass'd thro' the Countreys of the <hi>Arabitae, Oritae,</hi> and <hi>Gedrosii.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. He Encounter'd Greater Difficulties in the Country of the <hi>Gedrosii,</hi> than in all his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress in <hi>Asia:</hi> For thro' the scarcity of Water, Violence of heat and want of Provisions, he did not bring home one quarter of the forces he Transported to <hi>Asia.</hi> 'Tis said, he was forewarn'd of those Difficulties; For he was inform'd that <hi>Semiramis</hi> escap'd out of this Country only with 30, and <hi>Cyrus</hi> only with 7 Men, after they had offer'd to invade it. But that only whetted his Ambitious desires of outdoing their Glory. Having surmounted these Incredible Difficulties he arriv'd at <hi>Caramania.</hi> In the mean time, <hi>Nearchus</hi> being beaten by
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:136207:183"/> the <hi>Patalenians,</hi> made his way thro' a Rock to bring his Fleet into the Ocean, pass'd thro' the Countrys of the <hi>Arabitae, Oritae, Gedrosii</hi> and <hi>Iththyophagi,</hi> came into the Persian Bay, and arrivd at <hi>Ormus.</hi> There he had advice that the King was about five Days Journey off from that place: so he set out, and gave the King an account of his expedition, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to the Navy with Orders to continue his course to the mouth of the River <hi>Euphrates</hi> and from thence to <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. The King sent his Army into <hi>Persia,</hi> by Sea, under the Command of <hi>Hephestion:</hi> and vent himself over Land: Upon the Road as he came to <hi>Chalquera,</hi> he distributed Money to the Women, according to the Custom of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian Kings; and repair'd <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s Tomb. During his abode in <hi>Persia,</hi> he punish'd many Criminals; he Marryed <hi>Statira</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Darius,</hi> pay'd the Macedonians Debts, which did scarce amount to 10000 Talents; and bestow'd gifts upon every Man, in proportion to his Merit.</p>
               <p n="10">10. But his own Soldiers were not at all satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: for after he had Sail'd down the River <hi>Eulaeus</hi> into the Ocean, and return'd along <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gris</hi> as far as <hi>Opis,</hi> he call'd together all his Soldiers, and allow'd the invalids to return home, and promised mighty things to those that wou'd continue with him to finish the War: Now this they look'd upon as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and slighting of them. They consider'd that he inur'd himself to the Persian Customs, and put on their habit; that the Barbarians, were listed into the Company of his Friends;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:136207:183"/> that 30 young Men were pitched upon in the Provinces and bred to the Macedonian disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, whom he call'd <hi>Epigoni.</hi> Upon these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations they conjectur'd that their Country and Customs were slighted, and desir'd to be dismiss'd, intreating the King to carry on the War with the sole assistance of <hi>Jupiter Hammon</hi> his Father.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The King was mightily disturb'd upon this Occurrence. He gave Orders that 13 of the Soldiers who were presently taken up, shou'd be thrown headlong into the River. The rest he overlook'd, and shut himself up in the Tent for two Days without seeing any Body. On the third day, having Ordered the Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians to keep within their Trenches, he fill'd the best Posts of the Army with Barbarians; which gall'd the Macedonians so sensibly, that for three days together they imploy'd the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viest lamentations in suing for a Pardon; which at length with great difficulty they obtain'd. Then he dismissed all those who were not fit for War, and not only paid down their Arrears, but furnished them with Provisions for their Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and distributed a Talent to every Man. He likewise sent <hi>Craterus</hi> to Govern <hi>Macedonia,</hi> as successor to <hi>Antipater,</hi> who was to bring up the Auxiliary Troops. At length he arriv'd at <hi>Ecbatana</hi> the Metropolitan of <hi>Media,</hi> where <hi>Hephestion</hi> thro' drinking was seis'd with a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and not complying with a thin spare Diet, dyed in 7 days time. The King was so afflicted with his Death, that he Crucified <hi>Glaucus</hi> his Physician, and appointed an universal Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in which the City partak'd by removing the Ornaments off from their Walls.</p>

But soon after by hard drinking he was seiz'd with a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and died on the 11th Day. He Liv'd 32 Years and 8 Months, and Reign'd 12 Years and 8 Months.

               <head type="sub">Of the Affairs Transacted by <hi>Alexander's</hi> Officers after his Death, till the Empire was divided, and the respective Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours were stiled Kings. The Space of <hi>17</hi> Years.</head>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>ALexander</hi> left one Son, namely <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> his Bastard, by <hi>Barsine</hi> Daughter to <hi>Artabazus</hi> the Persian. <hi>Roxana</hi> Daughter

After long disputes about the Election of a Successor, the Officers at last agree'd, that <hi>Arideus</hi> shou'd be declar'd King; and that <hi>Perdiccas,</hi> to whom <hi>Alexander</hi> gave his Ring when he Dyed, shou'd be Guardian to the King, whose Intellectuals were but weak.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Then the Provinces were divided among the Officers, and <hi>Ptolomaeus</hi> the Son of <hi>Lagus</hi> made himself Master of <hi>Egypt</hi> without any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty. <hi>Perdiccas,</hi> envying his possession of so large a Country, gave the command of <hi>Cappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docia</hi> and the other Provinces to <hi>Eumenes,</hi> and March'd at the Head of an Army towards <hi>Egypt,</hi> carrying <hi>Arideus</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> along with him. In crossing the <hi>Nile</hi> he took no care of his Soldiers, so that some of them were swallowed up by the Waves, and others devoured by Crocodiles; upon which he was kill'd by some Horsemen, at the end of a 3 Years Regency. By the interest of <hi>Ptolomeus, Pithon</hi> and <hi>Arideus</hi> were Elected to serve in his room: but <hi>Pithon</hi> was so disturbed with the Calumnies of <hi>Euridice</hi> Wife to <hi>Arideus,</hi> that he resign'd his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and <hi>Antipater</hi> succeeded him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Antipater</hi> gave <hi>Antigonus</hi> the Command of the Army, to make Head against the <hi>Eumenes,</hi> who being left in <hi>Asia</hi> by <hi>Perdiccas,</hi> had kill'd <hi>Craterus in the Field,</hi> and was declar'd an Enemy by the Army. <hi>Antigonus</hi> Conquer'd <hi>Eumenes</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:136207:185"/> not by force but by stratagem, and besieged him in the Castle of <hi>Nora.</hi> But <hi>Antipater</hi> being Dead, and <hi>Polysperchon</hi> the Antientest of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders</hi>'s Officers, being left successor, <hi>Antigonus</hi> began to aspire at the whole Empire, and, in Order to make <hi>Eumenes</hi> his Friend, broke up the Siege, and took an Oath of him, which <hi>Emmenes,</hi> in <hi>Antigonus</hi>'s absence, accommodated to his own meaning. <hi>Antigonus</hi> finding the Oath turn'd to his purpose endeavour'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niew the Siege, but it was in vain. In the mean time <hi>Cassander</hi> the Son of <hi>Antipater</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed measures for possessing himself of <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and enter'd into a league with <hi>Ptolomaeus</hi> and <hi>Antigonus,</hi> the latter of whom promis'd to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all his interest on his behalf, and pretended a great deal of Friendship, thinking thereby to have a fairer opportunity of making himself Master of <hi>Asia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Polysperchon,</hi> in Order to make a stronger interest against <hi>Cassander,</hi> makes <hi>Eumenes</hi> his Friend, whom <hi>Olympias</hi> had frequently intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Letters, to stand by the Royal Family. <hi>Eumenes</hi> enlarg'd the number of his Forces, by Marching into the upper provinces, where the Governours joyn'd him with an Army of 18700 Foot and 4600 Horse. <hi>Antigonus</hi> pursu'd him and came to an Engagement in the Country of the <hi>Paraeteceni,</hi> and lost several of his Men; but the Victory was doubtful because <hi>Antigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>'s Men bury'd their dead first. After this battle the War was carry'd on by both Partys by stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems till after some time, that they came to a second Battle, in which <hi>Eumenes</hi> obtained the Victory; but the Conqueror was basely deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd up by his own Men, with his Hands ty'd
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:136207:185"/> behind his back, and after 3 Days fasting was kill'd. He was a very cunning Man, and in Warlike affairs was inferiour to none; he Dyed in the 8 year after <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Death.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Olympias</hi> being brought back by <hi>Polysper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chon</hi> and <hi>Aeacidas</hi> King of the <hi>Molossi,</hi> to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,</hi> together with <hi>Alexander</hi> her Grand-Child, made away King <hi>Arideus</hi> with his Wife <hi>Eurydice,</hi> the Daughter of that <hi>Amintas</hi> whom <hi>Phillip</hi> his Uncle and Guardian outted of his Kingdom, and <hi>Alexander</hi> robb'd of his Life. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympias</hi> did likewise Murder <hi>Nicanor</hi> the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Cassander,</hi> and hundreds of his other Friends. <hi>Cassander</hi> March'd from the <hi>Peloponne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> with an Army, and blocked up the Queen in <hi>Pydna;</hi> at last she was forc'd to surrender her self, and <hi>Cassander</hi> delivered her to those, whose Friends she had cruelly put to Death, to be punished with the loss of her life. In the mean time <hi>Antigonus</hi> does in the East what he pleases, he took off the Head of <hi>Pytho</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Media,</hi> for Ploting against him, and so frighted <hi>Seleucus</hi> Deputy Governour of <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> with calling him to give account of his Mony, that he fled into <hi>Egypt</hi> accompany'd by 50 Horse.</p>

Seleucus</hi> return'd to <hi>Babylon</hi> with 800 Foot and 20 Horse, and with these made himself Master of the Town. After that, he enlarg'd his Forces, and possess'd himself of <hi>Susiana, Media</hi> and other Countrys: So that he invested himself with the Power and Majesty of a King, and upon that account some Date the <hi>Aera</hi> of the Seleucidae or Grecians from this Year, it being the First Year of the 117 Olympiad, the 309 Year before Christ, the 12th Year after the Death of <hi>Alexander, A.

               <p n="8">8. <hi>Antigonus</hi> sent his Son <hi>Demetrius</hi> against <hi>Seleucus;</hi> in Opposition to whom <hi>Ptolomeus</hi> sent <hi>Calles</hi> to beat him out of <hi>Syria:</hi> but <hi>Demetri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> defeated him, and by so doing wip'd off the former Discredit. He took <hi>Babylon</hi> which the Enemy had forsaken, and possess'd himself of one Castle, leaving <hi>Archelaus</hi> to Master the other Fortifications. The time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd by his Father being Elaps'd he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to the Sea▪ and as he lay before <hi>Hali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnassus</hi> was beaten by <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> and so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to <hi>bid an Eternal Adieu</hi> to the upper Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.

               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:136207:186"/>9. Soon after a League was concluded between <hi>Ptolomaeus, Cassander, Lysimachus</hi> and <hi>Antigonus,</hi> upon these Terms, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Cassander</hi> should have the Command of <hi>Europe, Lysimachus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue Master of <hi>Thracia, Ptolomy</hi> retain Egypt and the other Countrys he was already possess'd of, till <hi>Alexander</hi> the Son of <hi>Roxana</hi> should be of Age, and that <hi>Antigonus</hi> should Command <hi>Asia</hi> and give Laws to the Grecians. This League quickly came to nothing, for every one catch't what he could come at; which they were the more capable to do, because he who was their Master, and seem'd to be over them all, was taken off.

               <p n="1">1 <hi>ANtigonus</hi> was encourag'd by his late Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess over <hi>Ptolomy</hi> to entertain the hopes of turning him out of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Accordingly he drew together some Troops at <hi>Antigonia,</hi> a City in <hi>Syria</hi> standing upon the River <hi>Orontes,</hi> and march'd with 'em to the Mouth of the

                  <hi>Nile;</hi> But finding no Ford for the passage of his Army, and that his Men were in Danger of being Corrupted by the Enemy, he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to return.

               <p n="2">2. Next Spring the Forces of these Princes were led forth to a fatal battle. <hi>Antigonus</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd at the Head of an Army of 70000 foot, 10000 Horse, and 75 Elephants. The Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Army consisted of 64000 Foot, 1500 Horse; 400 Elephants and 120 Coaches. <hi>Antigonus</hi> boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that with the throw of a Stone he wou'd disperse that Convention of Kings, like a flock of Birds; But in the Time of the battle he became very sad, and talk'd to his only Son, which he never did before, and Recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to his Army. The battle was fought at <hi>Ipsus</hi> a Town in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> in which <hi>Demetrius</hi> wretchedly ruin'd his Fathers Interest by his Temerity, in pursuing <hi>Antiochus</hi> the Son of <hi>Seleucus,</hi> whom he had put to flight, so far, that the Elephants intercepted his return; so that he cou'd neither return to his own nor assist his Father, who waited long for relief, and at last was kill'd by Darts in the 23 Year after the Death of <hi>Alexander,</hi> the 6 Year after he had
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:136207:188"/> taken upon him the Title of a King, the 4 Year of the 119 Olympiad, <hi>A. M.</hi> 3704.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Conquerors divided the Dominions of <hi>Antigonus</hi> among themselves; but it seems <hi>Ptolomaeus</hi> and <hi>Seleucus</hi> got the greater Part, and the differences they had concerning the Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the spoil were left undetermin'd to their Successors. <hi>Ptolomaeus</hi> possessed himself of <hi>Syria, Cyprus,</hi> and soon after of <hi>Cyrene,</hi> and gave his Daughter <hi>Arsinoe</hi> in Marriage to <hi>Lysimachus. Seleucus</hi> built the Town <hi>Seleucia</hi> and <hi>Antiocha</hi> so call'd either from Father or Son, to which he Transported the Inhabitants of <hi>Antigonia.</hi> He Married <hi>Stratonice</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius.</hi> Next Year <hi>Cassander</hi> King of <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> dy'd of a Dropsy, his Body being Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly overrun with Lice, after he had Reign'd 19 Years, in the 26 Year after the Death of <hi>Alexander, A.

               <p n="4">4. He left 3 Sons by <hi>Thessalonice</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Phillip;</hi> Namely, <hi>Phillip, Antipater,</hi> and <hi>Alexander. Phillip</hi> succeeded his Father, but was quickly cut off by a Consumption. <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pater</hi> kill'd his Mother because <hi>Alexander</hi> was her Favorite, tho' she conjur'd him by her Breasts to spare her Life: Upon this Wicked Action, the two Brethren fell out, and both of 'em call'd in Kings for their Assistance, and by this means were at once dispossess'd of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia</hi> and of their Lives: Thus it pleas'd God to Punish the Wickedness of <hi>Cassander,</hi> as the very Heathen Authors have observ'd. <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius,</hi> whom <hi>Alexander</hi> had call'd in, possess'd himself of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and was very bent upon beating <hi>Lysimachus</hi> out of <hi>Thracia.</hi> But <hi>Pyrrhus</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:136207:188"/> King of <hi>Epirus,</hi> by invading Thessaly, divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him and gave him a great deal of Trouble. Afterwards <hi>Demetrius</hi> made Peace with him, having many Great Projects in his head, and applying himself warmly to concert Measures for the Recovering of his Fathers Dominions.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He made Greater Preparations for War, and rais'd a Greater Army, than any that had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in one Body from the Death of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> to that day. It consisted of 100000 Foot, and 12000 Horse, besides 1500 Ships. This frighted <hi>Seleucus, Ptolomy,</hi> and <hi>Lysimachus,</hi> so that they enter'd into a Confederacy, and with joint in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties perswaded <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> to break the Peace. <hi>Lysimachus</hi> invaded <hi>Macedonia</hi> upon the <hi>Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> side, and <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> upon that of <hi>Epirus</hi> pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd himself of <hi>Byrrhea,</hi> and was declar'd King of <hi>Macedonia</hi> by <hi>Demetrius</hi>'s Army. But <hi>Lysimachus</hi> coming up claim'd a right to part of the Kingdom, and obtain'd it, <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> being Jealous of the Inconstancy of the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Demetrius</hi> being thus turn'd out of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,</hi> and toss'd up and down by hard For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, was at last oblig'd to Surrender himself to <hi>Seleucus</hi> his Son in Law. <hi>Seleucus</hi> gave him a very Civil Reception, and allow'd him his Liberty. At first he diverted himself with hunting; but afterwards forgetting his former dignity, he gave himself up to drinking and to the dice; and 3 Years after was seiz'd with a distemper which kill'd him, in the 54 Year of his Age. Soon after <hi>Lysimachus</hi> turn'd <hi>Pyrr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hus</hi> out of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> as being a stranger; and upon the Sollicitation of his Wife, kill'd <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gathocles</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:136207:189"/> his Eldest Son. The Wife of <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thocles</hi> and others, whose Relations were kill'd for Regrating his Death, press'd <hi>Seleucus</hi> to Revenge it upon the Tyrant. <hi>Lysimachus,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to avoid such an Inconvenience, cross'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to <hi>Asia,</hi> where he dy'd in a sharp battle fought in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> and having lost 15 of his Children before, by his own Death, compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Ruine of his Family. He dy'd in the 80th Year of his Age, 4 Years after his Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> 40 Years after the Death of <hi>Alexander,</hi> in the 2 Year of the 124 Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piad, <hi>A. M.</hi> 3722.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Seleucus</hi> was mightily puff'd up by his Victory, especially considering that he was the only Man of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Officers then alive. He gave <hi>Asia</hi> to his Son <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and set out for <hi>Macedonia,</hi> designing there to make his Exit. But after he cross'd the <hi>Hellespont</hi> he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected his course towards <hi>Lysimachia,</hi> and at a place call'd <hi>Argos</hi> was perfidiously murder'd by <hi>Ptolomaeus Ceraunus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Ptolomy</hi> by <hi>Eury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Antipater. Ptolomaeus</hi> had fled from <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Lysimachus</hi> his Brother in Law, upon his Younger Brother's being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to him; and upon the Death of <hi>Lysima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> made his address to <hi>Seleucus,</hi> who gave him a kind Reception, for which he did him this grateful turn. He distributed Money to <hi>Seleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi>'s Army, and was declar'd King. Afterwards in a Sea fight he defeated <hi>Antigonus Gonatas</hi> the Son of <hi>Polyorcetes,</hi> who attempted the Recovery of <hi>Macedonia;</hi> and so establish'd himself upon the Throne.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>PTolomaeus,</hi> to Establish his own Crown, Courted the Friendship of the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Kings. He Married his own Sister <hi>Arsinoe;</hi> Afterwards having Murder'd the Children in the Arms of the Mother, he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise gave her a divorce. About this time se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the Gauls, finding the Bounds of their own Country too Narrow, sally'd out in quest of New Seats under 3 Leaders. One Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny directed their course to <hi>Thracia</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>Cerethrius,</hi> the other came into <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonia</hi> under the Command of <hi>Brennus</hi> and <hi>Acicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> and the 3 setled in <hi>Macedonia</hi> being head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Belgius</hi> or <hi>Bolgius. Ptolomy</hi> rashly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging with the last of these was taken pris'ner by his Enemies, and miserably butcher'd, after he had been Master of <hi>Macedonia</hi> for a Year and a half.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Meleager Ptolomy</hi>'s Brother succeeded him, but at the end of two Months the <hi>Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> turn'd him out as unworthy of the Crown, and declar'd <hi>Antipater</hi> the Son of <hi>Philip</hi> King in his Room, who was afterwards call'd <hi>Etesias,</hi> by reason that he possess'd the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:136207:190"/> Crown only 45 Days. Then one <hi>Sosthenes</hi> drew together a body of Men, and check'd the Gauls, but declin'd the Title of a King, requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only an Oath of fidelity to him as their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. In the mean Time <hi>Brennus</hi> having notice that <hi>Bolgius</hi> was possess'd of such a goodly Spoil, invaded <hi>Macedonia</hi> with a Numerous Army, and defeated <hi>Sosthenes</hi> who oppos'd him. Having laid <hi>Mac d nia</hi> waste, he march'd into <hi>Greece</hi> with 152000 Foot and 20400 Horse. Each Horseman had two Servants who follow'd him, and succeeded to his Post when he died. This Custom was call'd <hi>Trimarkasia</hi> or rather <hi>Trimara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> for in the <hi>Anglo-Saxon</hi> and Teutonick Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages the word <hi>Mare</hi> signifies all sorts of Horse. When the Gauls march'd to <hi>Delphi,</hi> to pull down the Temple, as the Story goes, they were all knock'd down Dead by Thunderbolts, downfalls of Rocks, and such other means.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Sosthenes</hi> died after he had govern'd two Years, and <hi>Antigonus Gonnatas,</hi> having made Peace with <hi>Antiochus Soter,</hi> obtain'd <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and routed the Gauls whom <hi>Brennus</hi> had left to secure the Country. At this Time the Gauls, who had left <hi>Brennus</hi> when he invaded <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and had made Incursions into <hi>Thracia,</hi> and had scatter'd themselves up and down several places of <hi>Asia;</hi> gather'd into one Body, and assisted <hi>Nicomedes</hi> against <hi>Zypaeus</hi> who had pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd himself of part of <hi>Bithynia.</hi> Having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd him, and pillag'd the Countreys round about, they divided the Lands, and planted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves upon the River <hi>Halys,</hi> at a place which they Christen'd <hi>Gallograecia</hi> or <hi>Gallatia,</hi> in the 3d Year of the 125 Olympiad, <hi>A.

               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:136207:190"/>4. <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> King of <hi>Epirus,</hi> having carried on a successless War in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> for Six Years, returned Home, and expelled <hi>Antigonus Gonnatas;</hi> but did not possess the Kingdom Two Years; for he endeavoured to restore <hi>Cleonymus</hi> the Spartan, whom the Citizens had expelled; and being at <hi>Argi</hi> upon that Account, was killed with a Stone thrown by an old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whose Son he was about to kill. By this means, <hi>Antigonus</hi> recovered <hi>Macedonia.</hi> After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the Soldiers revolted from <hi>Antigonus</hi> to <hi>Alexander,</hi> the Son of <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> who expelled him: But his Son <hi>Demetrius</hi> re-instated him in his Throne, and expelled <hi>Alexander</hi> out of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,</hi> and kept him for some time out of his own Kingdom. <hi>Antigonus Gonnatas</hi> died when he was 80 Years old, 36 Years after his first accession to the Crown of <hi>Macedonia</hi> (but he was Governour of some Grecian Cities Ten Years before) the 2d Year of the 134 Olympi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad, <hi>A. M.</hi> 3762.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Demetrius</hi> his Son succeeded. He aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Etolians</hi> from himself, by solliciting <hi>Agron,</hi> King of the Illyrians, to relieve the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dionians, whom they at that time Besieged. He died Ten Years after. He left <hi>Philip</hi> his Son a Minor, and <hi>Antigonus</hi> the Brother, or else the Uncle of the deceased, was made his Guardian, who behaved himself so meekly and generously, that he was afterwards declared King. Upon the Death of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Cities lifted up their Heads, and having shak'd off the tyrannical Yoke, joyned in with the Achajans, who were mightily esteemed by their Neighbours for their Prudence and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:136207:191"/> having united into one Body, in the 124 Olympiad, and stirred up other Cities against the Macedonians.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Aratus</hi> the <hi>Sicyonian</hi> joyn'd his own Country to <hi>Achaia,</hi> and prov'd a great or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament and support to the interest of the <hi>Achaians,</hi> in freeing <hi>Athens</hi> from the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Yoak. But the <hi>Etolians</hi> were jealous of their Prosperity, and <hi>Cleomenes</hi> King of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> sided with 'em, who wanted any occasion of a War, in order to compleat the ruin of the <hi>Ephori</hi> which he had already projected. In effect the War was too hard for the <hi>Achaians,</hi> so that they were oblig'd to beg assistance from <hi>Antigonus Doson.</hi> He restor'd their tottering interest, and put a stop to <hi>Cleomenes's</hi> progress, who had already taken several Towns, and after several succesful attempts routed him in Battel to that degree, that he threw off all hopes, and fled from <hi>Lacedemon</hi> to <hi>Alexandria. Antigonus</hi> us'd the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> very civilly, and restor'd their Ancient Laws; but in the midst of his Glory was oblig'd to return to <hi>Macedonia,</hi> the <hi>Illyrians</hi> having invaded it. He went, and routed the <hi>Illyrians,</hi> but by shouting and crying aloud, fell into a spitting of blood, which threw him into a deep con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, and Cut the thread of his Life, after he had Govern'd <hi>Macedonia</hi> Ten Years, 100 Years after the death of <hi>Alexander,</hi> in the Second Year of the 139 <hi>Olympiad, A. M.</hi> 3782.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Antigonus</hi> being Dead, his Grandchild <hi>Philip</hi> succeeded. He was then 16 Years old. In him was the <hi>Sibylline</hi> Prophecy verifi'd, which foretold, that, as the Glory of <hi>Macedonia</hi> ow'd
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:136207:191"/> its first beginning to <hi>Philip,</hi> so <hi>Philip</hi> should one Day put an end to it. The <hi>Etolians</hi> were free'd of their fears when <hi>Antigonus</hi> died, and look'd out for any occasion of renewing the War with the <hi>Achaians;</hi> and at last by continually affronting them and their associats, occasion'd a confederat War. <hi>Aratus</hi> call'd in <hi>Philip</hi> to assist him. <hi>Philip</hi> took <hi>Ambracus</hi> which the <hi>Etolians</hi> had formerly taken from the People of <hi>Epyrus;</hi> then he invaded <hi>Etolia</hi> and laid the Country waste: Whereupon he was call'd home to defend <hi>Macedonia</hi> from the incursions of the <hi>Dardani,</hi> and the cruelty of <hi>Scopas</hi> the <hi>Etolian Praetor,</hi> who was then in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and put all to fire and Sword.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The <hi>Dardanians</hi> were scar'd by the news of his return, and retir'd to their own Country. When he arriv'd he possess'd himself of several fortified places, and carried on the War against the <hi>Etolians</hi> with a great deal of success. After all, when he heard that <hi>Hannibal</hi> the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> had routed the <hi>Romans</hi> at the lake <hi>Thrasimenus,</hi> he was over perswaded by <hi>Demetrius the Pharian,</hi> who had formerly fought for the <hi>Illyrians</hi> against the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> to neglect the <hi>Etolians,</hi> and mind the business of <hi>Illyricum,</hi> from whence he might pass into <hi>Italy,</hi> and by that means obtain the Monarchy of the whole World. Upon this project, he got an end put to that War, upon these terms, that each party should retain what they mutually possess'd. Besides, <hi>Angelaus</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Neupactum</hi> sollicited the <hi>Grecians</hi> to mediat for an accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, fearing they should become a prey either to the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> or <hi>Romans.</hi> Thus was that War concluded, after four Years standing, in the sixth Year of <hi>Philip,</hi> the first
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:136207:192"/> Year of the 141 Olympiad, <hi>A M.</hi> 3789.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Philip</hi> was altogether taken up with the Project of aggrandising himself, that <hi>Demetrius</hi> had suggested to him, and with that view, fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out a Fleet, in order to attack the <hi>Romans:</hi> But, upon their Arrival, his Marrines were siezed with such a fear, that he was obliged to retire. He sent an Ambassade to make a League with <hi>Hannibal</hi> the Victor, which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to upon these Terms, <hi>viz. That</hi> Philip <hi>should sail towards</hi> Italy, <hi>with about</hi> 200 <hi>Ships, in order to lay their Maritim Places waste; and to attack them both by Sea and Land; that</hi> Italy, <hi>when conquer'd, should wholly become a Prey to</hi> Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal <hi>and the</hi> Carthaginians, <hi>that</hi> Philip <hi>should have the Liberty to attack who he pleased of all that passed into</hi> Greece; <hi>and that he should continue Master of all the Places he possessed on the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, or in Islands.</hi> He was contented with these Terms. However, the Ambassadors, upon their return, were taken by the <hi>Romans;</hi> and others were afterwards sent, who brought the King certain Advice of the Confederacy.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>Philip</hi> was so transported with this Scheme, that he became a downright Tyrant. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to offer Injustice to the <hi>Grecian</hi> Cities; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advised so to do by the above mentioned <hi>Demetrius,</hi> who told him, That he ought to possess himself of the <hi>Peloponnesus,</hi> especially the two Horns of that Beast, as he called it, meaning the Castles of <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Messene.</hi> Pursuant to this Advice, he endeavoured to set the <hi>Messenians</hi> by the Ears among themselves, and used them unkindly; and poyson'd <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> for resenting the hard Treatment. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:136207:192"/> he attack'd the Cities of <hi>Illyricum:</hi> But <hi>Laevinus,</hi> the Roman Praetor, beat him out of <hi>Appollonia,</hi> and obliged him to return to <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,</hi> with the Loss of 3000 Men. Upon his Retreat, he made himself Master of several Towns; but <hi>Laevinus</hi> made his Reprisals, by bringing the <hi>Etolians</hi> off from their Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with him. However, he carry'd on the War against the <hi>Romans</hi> with tolerable Success, ever, till <hi>Sulpicius,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Praetor, defeated him at <hi>Elis,</hi> and the disorderly Condition of his Affairs in <hi>Macedonia</hi> called him Home.</p>
               <p n="11">11. His Adventures against the <hi>Etolians</hi> were Successful for three Years. At length they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing destitute of the <hi>Roman</hi> Assistance, which they trusted most in, were fain to accept of a Peace upon the King's own Terms. Soon after <hi>Sempronius,</hi> the Proconsul, succeeding to <hi>Sulpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi> did likewise make Peace with him in the name of the Romans, through the Mediation of the People of <hi>Epirus.</hi> The Articles of this Peace were, That the Cities <hi>Parthini, Diama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum, Bargalum</hi> and <hi>Eugenium,</hi> should continue in the Roman Hands; and that <hi>Attino</hi> should be under the Protection of <hi>Philip,</hi> pursuant to its own desire. In this League, the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded <hi>Prusias,</hi> King of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> the <hi>Achaians▪ Baeotians, Thessalians, Acarnanians,</hi> and those of <hi>Epirus:</hi> The Romans upon their side, included the Trojans, <hi>Attalus</hi> King of <hi>Pergamus, Pleura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> King of <hi>Thracia,</hi> the <hi>Eleans, Messenians,</hi> and <hi>Machanidas,</hi> Successor to <hi>Nabis,</hi> the Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian Tyrant. For the latter was killed in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel by <hi>Philipaemenes,</hi> who then began to defend his Country vigorously.</p>
               <p n="12">
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:136207:193"/>12. <hi>Philip</hi> being always accustomed to Action and fond of Glory, was uneasy under Peace. He envy'd the Fame of <hi>Philipaemenes</hi> so much, that he sent Assassins to take away his Life; by which Attempt, he procured to himself many Enemies. He entered into a League with <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus Magnus,</hi> and both of them conspired to turn young <hi>Ptolomy</hi> out of his Kingdom; but, as <hi>Polybius</hi> writes, they were scar'd by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans from pursuing their Design, and were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards punished for it. Being in Friendship with the <hi>Etolians,</hi> he scrupled not to snatch <hi>Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simachia</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon</hi> out of their hands, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the least colour of Justice: He likewise sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued the Town of the <hi>Caunij,</hi> which the <hi>Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> took so ill, that, from that time, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came his Enemies, and joyned in with <hi>Attalus.</hi> Notwithstanding the multitude of Projects he was engaged in, and the heavy Disasters he had met with; yet he kept up an invincible Spirit, full of great hopes, and had the Courage to wage War with the Romans, which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared against him after the end of the second Punick War, about 14 Years after his League with <hi>Hannibal,</hi> in the 23d Year of his Reign, the first Year of the 145 Olympiad.</p>
               <p n="13">13. The Romans charged him with the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation of the League, in injuring the <hi>Etolians,</hi> and other Confederates, and succouring <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> and the Carthaginians in <hi>Africa.</hi> The Athenians being Besieged by the King, begged the Assistance of the Romans; <hi>Attalus</hi> and the Rhodians complained that he attacked the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Cities in <hi>Asia. P. Sulpicius Galba</hi> was sent into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> while <hi>Philip</hi> invaded the <hi>Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonesus</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:136207:193"/> of <hi>Thracia,</hi> where the <hi>Abydians</hi> did a very memorable Action in standing out to the last Extremity. The King did not succeed in attacking <hi>Athens.</hi> In the mean time he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to make the <hi>Etolians</hi> his Friends, and made use of all Means to win their Favour; but they, who at first were doubtful, were ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily determined to side with the Romans, when they saw the King twice routed by the Consul.</p>
               <p n="14">14. The next Year, <hi>Tapsulus</hi> being Consul, nothing was done. But <hi>Titus Quintius Flamini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> his Successor, after an Interview to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, defeated him, and took several Places in <hi>Thessaly.</hi> At length, <hi>Philip</hi> finding that the <hi>Achajans</hi> deserted him, and sided with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nans,</hi> and that the Consul went on in storming and taking Towns, obtain'd a Truce of Two Months, and sent Ambassadors to <hi>Rome</hi> to treat of Peace. The <hi>Grecians</hi> likewise sent their Ambassadors to complain, That the King would not deliver <hi>Chalcis, Demetrias</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> which Towns he called the Fetters of <hi>Greece.</hi> Upon these Remonstrances, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate would not grant him Peace; but ordered <hi>Quintius</hi> to carry on the War. <hi>Quintius</hi> rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him at <hi>Cynocephale:</hi> Upon which Disaster, he desired a Truce of four Months, in order to send an Ambassador once more to <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. At last, the Senate and People of <hi>Rome</hi> gave him Peace upon these Terms, <hi>viz. That he should restore all</hi> Greece <hi>to its absolute Liberty; deliver all the Prisoners and Deserters; give up all Deck'd Ships, bating five and a great One; and pay half the Sum of one Hundred Talents that Year, and the rest within Ten Years.</hi> Ten Men were
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:136207:194"/> sent along with <hi>Flamininus</hi> into <hi>Greece,</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just the Concerns of the Cities, who were all overjoyed with the Motion, excepting the <hi>Eto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi> who censured the Decree, and cry'd out, That <hi>Greece</hi> had only chang'd her Masters, since <hi>Corinth, Demetrias</hi> and <hi>Chaleis</hi> were in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Hands.</p>
               <p n="16">16. <hi>Philip</hi> finding himself pinch'd by Necessity and hard Times, was very uneasy under his Condition; especially considering, that he had not the Liberty of punishing the Rebels; that he was oblig'd to restore the Towns he had taken to their rightful Proprietars; and that he was forced to yield to the querulous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrances of the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> of the <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manians,</hi> and of <hi>Eumenes</hi> King in <hi>Asia.</hi> He was mightily incensed, that the <hi>Romans</hi> were so very favourable to his Son <hi>Demetrius,</hi> whom he had sent thither as an Hostage; as if they had valued the Son's Friendship more than the Father's. This Jealousy was inflamed by <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seus,</hi> the elder Son, who suggested, that <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> aspired to the Crown; and by suborn'd Witnesses, carried the Charge so far, that the innocent Youth was put to Death, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the jealous and credulous Father. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Year or two after, the King fell into a fit of Melancholly and Grief for the want of his Son; upon which occasion, the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy was brought to light, by the Care and Diligence of <hi>Antigonus</hi> his Kinsman. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he was so oppressed with Grief and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, that he recommended <hi>Antigonus</hi> to the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> and cursed <hi>Perseus,</hi> and then died after he had reigned 44 Years, 146 Years after
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:136207:194"/> the death of <hi>Alexander,</hi> the 2d Year of the 150 Olympiad, <hi>A. M.</hi> 3826.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Had <hi>Philip</hi> lived longer, he had settled <hi>Antigonus</hi> on his Throne. But <hi>Perseus</hi> being acquainted with his Father's approaching Fate by his Physician, took timely care to crush his Enemies, and possessed himself of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. His Father left every thing in readiness for carrying on a War against the <hi>Romans,</hi> so that <hi>Perseus</hi> was engaged in it by way of Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: And indeed, he made it his only Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to provide for it, making use of all Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to keep under the <hi>Roman</hi> Allies. But when they appeared in Arms, he quickly recanted, and sued for Peace; but could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, the War being already decreed.</p>
               <p n="18">18. He engaged <hi>Genthius,</hi> King of the <hi>Illyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> on his side; but murder'd the Opportunity of doing Things to the purpose, by denying him Mony, of which he had great store, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on the War. It had been an easy matter to rout <hi>Marcius Philippus</hi> the Consul, who then made head against him, by reason of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of his Passage, and want of all manner of Provisions. But <hi>Perseus</hi> seemed to be conquered before they came to Fight, and resolving to flee, deserted all the narrow Passes, and gave his Enemy liberty to advance. He gave Orders for burning his Fleet at <hi>Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonica,</hi> and throwing his Treasure at <hi>Pella</hi> into the Sea. <hi>Marcius</hi> was succeeded by <hi>L. Aemilius Paulus,</hi> a second time Consul, who routed the King and his Army, consisting of 39000 Foot and 4000 Horse, not far from <hi>Pydna;</hi> and took the King Prisoner, together with his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:136207:195"/> and Children, and carried him to <hi>Rome</hi> in Triumph. He died at <hi>Rome,</hi> after he had been two Years Prisoner, having reigned 11 Years. Then the <hi>Macedonians</hi> were made free, and this was the end of that Kingdom, in the 156 Year after the death of <hi>Alexander,</hi> the 2d Year of the 153 Olympiad, <hi>A. M.</hi> 3837.</p>

But <hi>Ptolomaeus Ceraunus,</hi> as I told you before, killed him by the way, in the 23d Year after his being Invested with the regal Dignity, the 42d Year after the Death of <hi>Alexander</hi> and the 73d of his Age. He was sirnamed <hi>Nicanor,</hi> or <hi>Nicator,</hi> with regard to the Victories he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; and 'tis said, had an Anchor imprinted upon his Thigh, and his Posterity was noted by the same Mark.</p>

                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:136207:195"/>2. <hi>Seleucus</hi> being Dead, his Son <hi>Antiochus</hi> succeeded. He was sirnamed <hi>Soter,</hi> for repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the <hi>Gauls,</hi> who over-run a great part of <hi>Asia,</hi> when they were called in by <hi>Mithridates,</hi> King of <hi>Bithynia.</hi> He gave his Daughter <hi>Apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mea</hi> in Marriage to <hi>Maga,</hi> King of <hi>Cyrene,</hi> and Brother to <hi>Ptolomaeus Philadelphus;</hi> Upon whose Sollicitation, he violated the Treaty of <hi>Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> with the King of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> but was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented in accomplishing his designed Invasion, by the Forces which <hi>Ptolomy</hi> sent into <hi>Asia.</hi> He likewise waged War with <hi>Eumenes,</hi> King of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> but with little Success.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This <hi>Eumenes</hi> was Nephew to <hi>Philotaerus</hi> the Eunuch, who was Keeper of <hi>Lysimachus</hi>'s Treasure at <hi>Pergamus,</hi> and revolted from him at the time when he ordered his Son <hi>Agathocles</hi> to be put to Death, and possess'd himself both of the Place and the Mony, while the Kings were worrying one another. Afterwards, he converted his Lordship into a Kingdom, and left it to his Nephew. <hi>Antiochus</hi> built two Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, called <hi>Apameae,</hi> from his Mother and Wife. He murdered one of his Sons, and left the other to succeed him. He Died in the 19th Year of his Reign, the 2d Year of the 129 Olympiad, A. M. 3742.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Antiochus Soter</hi> was followed by <hi>Antiochus</hi> his Son, whom the Milesians impiously sirna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Theos,</hi> because he rescued them from the Tyrranny of <hi>Timarchus.</hi> 'Twas in his time, that the <hi>Parthians</hi> first revolted; who being originally banisht out of <hi>Scythia</hi> (for <hi>Parthus,</hi> in the <hi>Scythian</hi> Language, signifies a banished Man) were in an obscure and contemptible Condition, when the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:136207:196"/> Medes and Persians sat at the Helm of Affairs. They were conquered by <hi>Alexander,</hi> but after his Death slighted his Captains, and subjected themselves to the Government of one <hi>Stesagenor</hi> a Stranger, but a Friend to the Macedonians. They served <hi>Eumenes, Antigonus</hi> and <hi>Seleucus,</hi> and continued Obedient to the Successors of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leucus,</hi> till now, that they Rebelled, being Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Arsaces;</hi> and slew <hi>Agathocles,</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of these Countries, for offering Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to <hi>Tiridates,</hi> the Brother of <hi>Arsaces;</hi> and expelled the Macedonians. About the same time, <hi>Theodotus,</hi> Governour of 1000 Bactrian Cities, likewise Revolted, and in Imitation of his Example, the People of the East withdrew themselves from the Macedonian Yoke.</p>
               <p n="5">5.

For when <hi>Philadelphus</hi> died, <hi>Antiochus</hi> took in <hi>Laodice</hi> again, who, fearing the Levity and Inconstancy of her Husband, poisoned him in the 15th Year of his Reign.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Laodice</hi> conceal'd the Kings Death till the Kingdom was Transferr'd to her Son <hi>Seleucus,</hi> and besieg'd <hi>Berenice</hi> her Rival in <hi>Daphne.</hi> The Cities of <hi>Asia</hi> were mov'd with Compassion towards the besieged Queen, and <hi>Ptolomy</hi> set out with all Possible Expedition to Relieve his
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:136207:196"/> Sister; but she unfortunately surrender'd before the Relief came up, and was perfidiously mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd together with her Son. The Cities de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing such a Barbarous Action Revolted and sided with <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> who marched further into <hi>Syria,</hi> kill'd <hi>Laodice,</hi> made himself Master of <hi>Caelosyria, Syria</hi> and <hi>Seleucia,</hi> overrun almost all <hi>Asia</hi> as far as <hi>Bactra;</hi> and had certainly possess'd himself of all <hi>Seleucus</hi>'s Dominions, had not a Domestick Sedition diverted him from so great an Enterprise. <hi>Seleucus</hi> had fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out a Fleet in order to Retrieve his Cities, but it was all lost by Shipwrack: By which misfortune the Cities were so much influenc'd, that of their own accord they surrender'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Seleucus</hi> finding that the loss of his Ships had produc'd such mighty Effects, declar'd War against <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> and after a Successless adventure was oblig'd to flee into <hi>Antiochia,</hi> where he was again reduc'd to the same Straits, but did not meet with the same Relief. He call'd in <hi>Antiochus</hi> his Brother to assist him, who tho' very Young, was so eager in making use of this Opportunity, to possess himself of the whole Kingdom, that he signaliz'd his courage in invading Countries and taking Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and was thereupon sirnam'd <hi>Hierax. Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy</hi> having no mind to Engage them both at once, concluded a Peace with <hi>Seleucus</hi> for 10 Years. Peace being concluded <hi>Antiochus</hi> hir'd the Gauls, and with them march'd against his Brother and conquer'd him. The Gauls, fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying that <hi>Seleucus</hi> was kill'd in battel, Resolv'd to put to Death all the race of <hi>Seleucus,</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:136207:197"/> and to that End made an Insurrection against <hi>Anciochus</hi> himself, but at last they were gain'd by Arms of Gold. <hi>Asia</hi> being thus pull'd in Pieces, <hi>Eumenes</hi> the <hi>Bythinian</hi> annex'd part of it to his Dominions.</p>

The <hi>Parthians</hi> Celebrated the Day of that Victory every Year, and dated their Liberty from it; and <hi>Arsaces</hi> was as much esteem'd by them, as <hi>Cyrus</hi> was by the <hi>Persians,</hi> or <hi>Alexander</hi> by the <hi>Macedonians;</hi> and succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kings were call'd by his Name. Now the beginning of the Reign of <hi>Arsaces,</hi> is cast into the 1 Year of the 135 Olympiad, 510 after the building of <hi>Rome,</hi> the 2 of <hi>Seleucus,</hi> the 3 of <hi>Ptolomaeus Euerges, A.

               <p n="9">9. Tho' the Interest of the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd every day, and the two Brothers were e'en almost outted of their Governments, yet they Neglected their Forreign concerns, and renew'd a Civil War, in which <hi>Antiochus</hi> was at last conquer'd, and fled first to <hi>Ptolomy</hi> and then to <hi>Artamenes</hi> the <hi>Cappadocian</hi> his Father in Law; but but neither of them could secure him, so that he fell into the Hands of the Robbers and was kill'd. About the same time <hi>Seleucus</hi> being outted of his Kingdom, ended his days by a fall from his Horse, having Reign'd about
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:136207:197"/> 10 Years, in the 98 Year after the death of <hi>Alexander,</hi> the 3 Year of the 138 Olympiad, A. M. 3779. He was sirnam'd <hi>Callinicus</hi> from his Victories, and <hi>Pogon</hi> from his beard.</p>
               <p n="10">10. He left two Sons, <hi>Seleucus</hi> and <hi>Antiochus.</hi> The former (call'd <hi>Ceraunus</hi>) succeeded his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the 7 Year of <hi>Antigonus Doson.</hi> He indeavour'd to recover that part of <hi>Asia</hi> on this side of the <hi>Taurus</hi> which <hi>Eumenes</hi> K. of <hi>Pergamus</hi> possess'd, but was poyson'd by <hi>Apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turius</hi> of <hi>Galatia,</hi> and <hi>Nicanor,</hi> when he had scarce Govern'd Three Years. <hi>Achaeus</hi> his General, Nephew to Queen <hi>Laodice,</hi> punish'd the Parricides, and manag'd affairs so dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously that he reduc'd all <hi>Asia</hi> to Obedience, and was so well belov'd by the People, that he might have possess'd himself of the Kingdom with ease, but he would not cheat <hi>Antiochus Seleucus</hi>'s Brother of his Right. This <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> was afterwards Sirnam'd the <hi>Great.</hi> While his Brother liv'd he resided in the upper Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces; But now he was call'd to Babylon in the 15 Year of his Age, to take upon him the Administration of Affairs; Accordingly he came, and made <hi>Achaeus</hi> Governour of the Country he had lately Recover'd, <hi>Molon</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Media,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> Governour of <hi>Persia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. <hi>Antiochus</hi> was quickly pinch'd with great Troubles, upon the Account of the overgrown power of one <hi>Hermias,</hi> a Court-favourite, which <hi>Molon</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> his Brethren, took so ill, that they alienated the upper Provinces from their Allegiance. The King designed to march against them; but <hi>Hermias</hi> over perswaded
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:136207:198"/> him to turn his Arms against <hi>Ptolomaeus Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pator,</hi> who thinking himself Secure upon the account of <hi>Antiochus</hi>'s Youth, was entirely wra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p'd up in his Pleasures. But that War procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded but heavily; and in the mean time <hi>Molon</hi> carried on his rebellious Designs, so that the King was obliged to return. Whereupon, he quashed the Rebels without any Difficulty, and took timely care to put <hi>Hermias</hi> to Death, finding him engaged in Seditious Designs. At the same time <hi>Achaeus,</hi> having laid by his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Modesty, took upon him the Diadem and regal Title. However, <hi>Antiochus</hi> renewed the War with <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> upon the account of <hi>Caelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syria,</hi> which the Aegyptians continued Masters of, from the time that it was taken by <hi>Euergetes</hi> when he went to rescue his Sister <hi>Berenice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. He got <hi>Seleucia</hi> by Treachery, and made himself Master of several other Places; but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Advice of <hi>Achaeus</hi> his Advances, he agreed to a Truce, in order to an Interview concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Peace. But many Objections being started on both sides, neither Prince would yield to the other; so that the War broke out again next Spring, and <hi>Antiochus</hi> reduced several Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. After one Year, <hi>Ptolomy</hi> advanced to <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> with 70000 Foot, 5000 Horse, and 73 Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants. <hi>Antiochus</hi> made Head against him with 72000 Foot, 6000 Horse, and 102 Elephants: And defeated the Enemy; but, out of a juvenile Ardor, pursued him too far, and when he returned, found his whole Army rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and was fain to retire to <hi>Raphia</hi> and go Home. All <hi>Caelosyria</hi> surrendered it self to <hi>Ptolomy</hi> the Victor. <hi>Antiochus,</hi> fearing he would
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:136207:198"/> pursue the Victory, sent Ambassadors with Proposals of Peace. The Embassy found <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy</hi> very inclinable to Peace, and entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to his Luxury and other Vices, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Opportunity he was then presented with, of turning <hi>Antiochus</hi> out of his Kingdom.</p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>Antiochus,</hi> being rid of all Fears upon that hand, marched against <hi>Achaeus,</hi> and block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him up in <hi>Sardes. Achaeus</hi> being deceived by the hopes of Favour, and betrayed, fell into the hands of the King, and was brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dign Punishment for his Rebellion. About a Year or two after that, <hi>Antiochus</hi> made a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress into the upper Provinces, reduced several Countries, and mastered some Towns and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities on this side of the Mountain <hi>Taurus.</hi> He managed the Administration of Affairs with so much Prudence, that his Subjects had a great Opinion of him, and by that means were more easily kept in their Duty. When <hi>Ptolomaeus Philopator</hi> died, he and <hi>Philip</hi> K of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> conspired against the young King, possessed themselves of <hi>Judea,</hi> and quickly lost it again: He likewise invaded the Territories of <hi>Attalus</hi> K. of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> but the Romans commanded him Home.</p>
               <p n="14">14. He was resolved at this time to obey the People of <hi>Rom,</hi> because he found himself not able to coap with them: But soon after, there prevailed such Jealousies between him and them, as at last broke out into a War. For after the Conquest of <hi>Caelosyria,</hi> he attacked the Grecian Cities in <hi>Asia,</hi> which the Romans took under their Protection, and order'd him to desist; thinking, that if he succeeded in <hi>Asia,</hi> he would
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:136207:199"/> extend his Conquests to <hi>Europe;</hi> especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that <hi>Hannibal,</hi> whom he had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, sollicited him to invade <hi>Italy. Antiochus</hi> in order to Fortify himself by Alliances, gave his Daughter <hi>Cleopatra</hi> in marriage to <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> with <hi>Caelosyria</hi> as her Dowry; and his other Daughter <hi>Antiochis</hi> to <hi>Ariathres,</hi> King of the Cappadocians. The Roman Ambassadors ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving pressed for Peace in vain, he joyn'd in with the Etolians, who, after the Conquest of <hi>Philip,</hi> fell out with the Romans about the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of the Spoil, and departed from their Alliance, and now stirr'd up all the Neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Princes against them.</p>
               <p n="15">15. When he passed into <hi>Greece,</hi> he married a Woman of a mean Birth, and suffer'd his Army to be enervated by the Softness of the Place. At the <hi>Streights</hi> of <hi>Thermopylae</hi> he was routed by <hi>Glabrio,</hi> the Roman Consul, and fled to <hi>Ephesus.</hi> The Consul mastered <hi>Phoris, Bae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otia</hi> and <hi>Eubaea.</hi> Then <hi>Antiochus,</hi> applying his mind to Sea Affairs, was often beaten at Sea, and oblig'd to break up the Siege of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> without doing any thing to the purpose. Upon the approach of <hi>Scipio</hi> with a great Army, he marched his Garrisons out of <hi>Lysimachia,</hi> which might have given the Romans a great deal of Trouble, and, like a Mad-man, suffered the Consul to have a free Passage into <hi>Asia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. <hi>Antiochus</hi> sent Ambassadors to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul with Proposals of Peace; but the Consul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, That he should reinburse the Charges of the War, and not only part with <hi>Aeolia</hi> and <hi>Jonia,</hi> but with all <hi>Asia</hi> besides, on this side of the Mountain <hi>Taurus.</hi> He look'd upon these
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:136207:199"/> Terms as too hard, and therefore resolved to try the Fortune of a Battel; but being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, was forc'd to submit to Terms that were much the same with those above-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. After that Disaster, he was wont, as <hi>Cicero</hi> tells us, to say, That he was obliged to the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> for freeing him of too great a Charge, &amp; leaving him the moderate Compass of his own Kingdom. Two years after, he made a Progress into the upper Provinces, and Sack'd the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Belus</hi> in <hi>Elymais;</hi> which Wickedness did so incense the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, that they slew him and his whole Army. Some say, that after he crossed the <hi>Taurus,</hi> he was killed by his own Companions, for beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in his Drink. He Died in the 36th year of his Reign, the 2d year of the 148 O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympiad, 185 years before <hi>Christ,</hi> A. M. 3818, in the Consulship of M. <hi>Aemilius Lepidus,</hi> and <hi>C. Flaminius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17. <hi>Antiochus Magnus</hi> being Dead, his Son <hi>Seleucus Philopator</hi> succeeded, in the 35th year of <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia.</hi> He kept close at Home for fear of the Romans, and after 12 years, was killed by <hi>Heliodorus.</hi> He left one Son, a Child, called <hi>Demetrius,</hi> whom he had sent to <hi>Rome</hi> as an Hostage, in the room of his Brother <hi>Antiochus;</hi> for sometimes the Romans oblig'd 'em to shift their Hostages. <hi>Antiochus,</hi> upon his return, possessed himself of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. He was called <hi>Epiphanes</hi> by the Syrians, because he recovered the Kingdom of the <hi>Seleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidae</hi> from <hi>Heliodorus.</hi> Others call'd him <hi>Epima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> with allusion to his phanatical Gestures. But the Angel of the <hi>Lord</hi> stil'd him a <hi>mean Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:136207:200"/>18. <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> being the Uncle of <hi>Ptolomaeus Philometor,</hi> who had lately succeeded his deceased Father, declared himself Guardian to the young Prince: And in order to make away with him, and to fetch the Administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Affairs into his own hands, made four several Journeys into <hi>Aegypt.</hi> But the Plot being discovered, the Romans, upon the Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation of the Egyptians, sent <hi>C. Popilius Lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi> with two others, as Ambassadors to him. When they came to an interview, he demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the name of the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Antiochus</hi> should depart from <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which he was just going to block up. <hi>Antiochus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired time to consider of the Proposal; but <hi>Laenas</hi> made a Circle of Sprigs round about him as he stood, and told him downright, that he must give his Answer before he step'd out of that Compass. He being well acquainted with the Power of the Romans, was thus frighted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Promise of Peace.</p>
               <p n="19">19. As soon as he returned from <hi>Aegypt,</hi> he besieged <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and carried it, and put 80000 Jews to the Sword, and sold as many, in Resentment of the Joy they had expressed upon the Sham-News of his Death. Having pillag'd the Temple, and carried off 1800 Talents he left some Tyrannical Ministers behind him, who heavily oppressed the People. Two years after, he sent thither one <hi>Apollonius,</hi> a very cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el Man, with Orders to put to death all the Men that were of Age, and to expose the Women and Children to Sale. At last, being repulsed from <hi>Aegypt,</hi> he issued forth an Edict, enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his Subjects, under the pain of Death, to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:136207:200"/> observe the Religion of the Greeks; and sent some Men up and down the Countries, to oblige them to perform that sort of Worship. Into <hi>Judaea</hi> he sent an old Athenian, with Orders to consecrate their pillaged Temple to <hi>Jupiter O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lympius,</hi> and the other Temple built on Mount <hi>Gerizim,</hi> to <hi>Jupiter Hospitalis;</hi> and to prohibit the Inhabitants to use the Mosaick Law. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, the Idol of <hi>Jupiter Olympius</hi> was set up in the Temple, and the holy Scriptures commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Flames, which all the Inhabitants were prohibited to keep by them, or to approve of.</p>
               <p n="20">20. But many of the Inhabitants refusing to comply with his impious Demands, chearfully suffered Death; and others followed <hi>Mattathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> the Priest, who drew together a Company of Men, oppos'd the King's Tyranny, pulled down their Altars, and circumcised the Jewish Children. But a Year was scarce elaps d, when <hi>Mattathias</hi> died. He was the Son of <hi>John,</hi> the Grand-Child of <hi>Simeon,</hi> the great Grand-Child of <hi>Asmonaeus</hi> or <hi>Hasmonaeus,</hi> whose Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity were called <hi>Hasmonaei</hi> after him. <hi>David</hi> the Psalmist, King, and Prophet, by <hi>Hasmannim</hi> means Ambassadors or Princes. And the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Jews call the Roman Cardinals <hi>Hasmannim</hi> or <hi>Hasmonaei.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="21">21. <hi>Mattathias</hi> was follow'd by his Son and Successor <hi>Judas Maccabaeus,</hi> who conquered and killed <hi>Apollonius,</hi> Governour of <hi>Samaria;</hi> whose Death the King resented so much, that when he could not perform his designed Journey himself, he sent several Officers against him with a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Body of Forces: But <hi>Judas,</hi> by Virtue of the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:136207:201"/> Divine Assistance, routed them all, march'd to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> purged the Temple, which the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens had possess'd for three years, offered Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice upon a new Altar, and celebrated an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversary Feast of Dedication for 8 Days.</p>
               <p n="22">22. <hi>Antiochus</hi> having made a Progress into the upper Provinces in order to raise Mony, conquer'd <hi>Artaxias</hi> King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and took him Prisoner. But upon the News of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat of his Men in <hi>Judea,</hi> being full of Wrath and Revenge, he made all possible Preparations for a speedy return. But it pleas'd the Divine Majesty, to Punish him with such a horrible distemper, that the Worms grew out of his Body while he was yet alive, and his putrified Body became such a Nuseance that the Army could not bear the smell on't. Some say that he Repented out of a Sense of the Just Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, and wrote very Civil Letters to the Jews. He Nominated <hi>Philip</hi> his School-fellow as <hi>Guardian</hi> to his Son, and dy'd in the 12 Year of his Reign, the 149 of the <hi>Seleucidae,</hi> the 1 Year of the 154 Olympiad, <hi>A.

               <p n="23">23. <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes</hi> was follow'd by his Son and Successor <hi>Antiochus,</hi> a Child of 9 Years of Age, whom the <hi>Syrians</hi> Christen'd <hi>Eupator,</hi> with Regard to his Father's Virtue. <hi>Lysias,</hi> who formerly had the charge of his Education turn'd out <hi>Philip,</hi> and manag'd all as he pleas'd.

But the adventure proving Successless, he made Peace with the Jews: which was afterwards Violat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Timothy</hi> and some other Captains, who renew'd the war; but were routted, together with the <hi>Arabs, Nomades, Edomits</hi> and <hi>Philistines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="24">24. These adventures did so provoke <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ochus Eupa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#uom" extent="1 letter">

Indeed he quickly crush'd <hi>Philip;</hi> but soon after he himself was forc'd to undergo the same fate by <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Son of <hi>Seleucus Philopator,</hi> who fled from <hi>Rome</hi> in order to possess himself of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. <hi>Demetrius</hi> having gain'd the Kingdom was Christen'd <hi>Soter,</hi> and endeavour'd by all means to get into Favour with the <hi>Romans.</hi> He sent <hi>Bachides</hi> to make head against the Jews, and after him <hi>Nicanor,</hi> who at first Treated <hi>Judas</hi> with all manner of Civility, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards being check'd by the King prov'd Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous to him. He cast forth many Impious Expressions in the Temple, but being kill'd in battel was punish'd for his Blasphemy. The Jews Consecrated the 13 Day of the Month <hi>Adar</hi> to the Memory of so great a Victory, as the Author of the last Book of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> informs us, who in Recounting that Story Comprehends an Epitome of the 5 Books of <hi>Jason</hi> a Jew of <hi>Cyrene.</hi>

In the mean Time <hi>Demetrius</hi> gave himself altogether to Luxury, and, by that Means, drew upon himself the Hatred of his People; which, assisted by the Interest of <hi>Atta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, Ariarathres</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> suborn'd a young Man of an obscure Birth, who pretended to be the Son of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> and aspired to the Crown.</p>
               <p n="26">26. His Name was <hi>Balas</hi> or <hi>Balles;</hi> but his honorary Name was <hi>Alexander.

Accordingly, in the 7th Month of the 161 year of the <hi>Seleucidae,</hi> and 9 years after the death of <hi>Judas Maccabaeus,</hi> the Chair having remain'd vacant 7 years from the Death of <hi>Alcimus,</hi> was <hi>Jonathan</hi> invested with the sacred Robes.

At last, they petitioned for Peace, and had it upon these Terms, <hi>viz.</hi> That they should lay down their Arms, level the Walls with the Ground, and should pay 5500 Talents, together with Tribute for <hi>Joppa</hi> and the other outlying Towns.</p>
               <p n="31">31. <hi>Antiochus</hi> waged War with the Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and obtained several Victories, and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced several Provinces, which the Insolence of his Soldiers provoked to Revolt; after which, himself was killed in an Engagement with <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saces.

In the 20 Year of <hi>Antiochus Magnus, Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomaeus Epiphanes</hi> Son to <hi>Ptolomaeus Philopator</hi> by his Sister, being then 5 Years Old, succeeded his Father. The People put to Death <hi>Agatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> with his Sister and Mother, and made <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristomenes Acarnanes</hi> Guardian to the King, who was very happy in the Administration of Affairs. <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Antiochus Magnus</hi> King of <hi>Asia</hi> conspir'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against <hi>Ptolomy.

At last, in order to carry on a War with <hi>Seleucus Philopator,</hi> he enter'd into a league with the <hi>Achaians;</hi> But his Ministers fancying that the Charges of the War wou'd Rob them of their profits, took him off by poison, after he had Reign'd 24 Years, in the 1 Year of the 150 Olympiad, A.

He was likewise stil'd <hi>Physcon,</hi> with Allusion to his big belly. Afterwards <hi>Philometor</hi> return'd, but the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens expell'd him. <hi>Antiochus,</hi> under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of restoring him, continued the War, but finding himself not able to carry <hi>Alexandria,</hi> went off to <hi>Syria;</hi> and left all Egypt to <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metor,</hi> excepting <hi>Pelusium,</hi> which he reserv'd as a door for him to enter by when the 2 Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren shou'd have exhausted their strength up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one another.

And ev'n that did not satisfy him, for he afterwards undertook a Second Journey, but what the Result of it was we do not know. While <hi>Philometor</hi> Reign'd, <hi>Onas</hi> a Jew Son to <hi>Onias</hi> the 3 Priest, finding his Family turn'd out of the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, obtain'd a Decree for building a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Province of <hi>Heliopolis,</hi> which Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> in every thing, bating that, instead of a Candlestick, it had a Lamp hung upon a Gold Wire, which darted its beams all about in Imitation of the Sun. The Jews and Samaritans disputed the antiquity of their Temples in the presence of <hi>Ptolomy;</hi> And the Samaritan Orators being worsted, were Punish'd with the loss of their Heads, pursuant to the Contract mutually agreed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand.

Whereas formerly the Son succeeded the Father, <hi>Physcon</hi> oblig'd <hi>Cleopatra</hi> his Brothers Widdow to marry him, and slew his own little Son in the Arms of it's Mother the very day of the Marriage. The progress of his Reign was all of a piece with the beginning; cruelty and barbarity shin'd thro' every part of it; every Place was fill'd with detestable Murders, and Mercy was shown to none. The <hi>Alexandrians</hi> took his Wicked Actions so much to heart, that most of 'em deserted the City, which he afterwards fill'd with New Citizens. But he quickly render'd himself so odious to them, that they set his Palace on Fire, and banish'd him, and put the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom into the hands of <hi>Cleopatra</hi> his Sister. But afterwards he made Friends with his Sister and Repossess'd the Kingdom. He dy'd, when he had Reign'd 29 Years by himself, in the last Year of the 156 Olympiad, A. M. 3888.</p>
               <p n="11">11. He left 3 Sons and as many Daughters.

She fancying that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Youngest would be most Obedient to her, design'd to give him a share in the Government; but the People being against it, she sent for <hi>Lathurus,</hi> whom she afterwards expell'd, and pursu'd with that Ardour, that all his Interpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses in <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Coelosyria</hi> were render'd abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. She made it her business for some Years to undermine <hi>Alexander;</hi> but he smelling the

This <hi>Aule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> was a bastard, as well as his Brother the King of <hi>Cyprus;</hi> For <hi>Pausanias</hi> tells us that <hi>Lathurus</hi> left no Legitimate children, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one Daughter. After a few Years his Subjects outted him of the Kingdom, because he would not attempt the Recovery of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> which the <hi>Romans</hi> had taken from his Brother; or rather, because he exacted a great Sum of Money from them, with which he purchas'd the Friendship and Alliance of the <hi>Romans.</hi>

From thence he went to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and with a goodly Sum of Talents engag'd <hi>Gabinius</hi> Governour of <hi>Syria</hi> to Restore him. After his Restoration he did no Memorable Action; bating, that after Four Years he died in the 2 Year of the 182 Olympiad, <hi>A. M.</hi> 3954. He had two Sons and as many Daughters, and order'd the Elder of both Sexes, who were joyn'd in Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, to Reign together.

But he, by the advice of <hi>Theodatus</hi> his Preceptor, receiv'd <hi>Pompey</hi> into a Boat, and slew him; Thinking thereby to win <hi>Coesar</hi>'s good will.</p>
               <p n="14">14. But <hi>Caesar,</hi> by demanding the Money that <hi>Auletes</hi> ow'd to the <hi>Romans,</hi> incurr'd the hatred of the <hi>Alexandrians,</hi> and while he made it his business to bring the King and his Sister to a good understanding, <hi>Pothinus</hi> carried on a War against him. For <hi>Cleopatra's</hi> sake he Encounter'd many difficulties. At last, the <hi>Alexandrians</hi> being worn out by many Successive Disasters, he master'd their Camp; and their King himself retiring into a little boat, was drown'd in the River, by the Crouds of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:136207:209"/> that pour'd into the boat and sunk it. <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi> carried <hi>Alexandria</hi> without any difficulty, for the Citizens surrender'd themselves upon Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. However he did not annex Egypt to the <hi>Roman</hi> Dominions, but return'd it to <hi>Cleopatra</hi> his Miss. She Married her Brother, who was then 11 Years Old, and after 4 Years poyson'd him, in order to engross the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to her self.</p>
               <p n="15">15.

Then they return'd to their wonted Luxury, and invited all that were fearless of Death to enjoy themselves in the present use of all agreeable Pleasures. But she did not fail to Court the Favour of <hi>Caesar,</hi> by betraying into his hands <hi>Pelusium</hi> with the Navy and Cavalry. <hi>Antonius</hi> indeed suspected her Treachery, but was wheedled by the fair Insinuations of a Flattering Woman. When <hi>Caesar</hi> was just upon the borders of Egypt, she suborn'd People to tell <hi>Antony</hi> as if she had laid Violent Hands on her self, for fear of the Conquerour: Upon which News <hi>Antony</hi> stab'd himself in the Belly. Then she bewail'd his Death with many moans and heavy Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>

She was a Woman of a Masculine Spirit, and richly endow'd with the Gifts of Nature.

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>ANtiochus Sidetes</hi> march'd from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> against the <hi>Parthians;</hi> and when he came to battel, receiv'd a wound of which he died. <hi>John</hi> the Prince and High Priest of the Jews accompanied him, and was sirnam'd <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> from defeating the <hi>Hyrcanians.</hi> At this time the <hi>Seleucidae</hi> were still disputing their right to the Kingdom; from whence he took occasion to settle himself in the Government and master'd several Cities in <hi>Syria,</hi> and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:136207:211"/> the <hi>Idumaei</hi> whom he oblig'd to comply with the Circumcision. He renew'd the League which <hi>Judas Maccabeus</hi> made with the <hi>Romans,</hi> and took and destroy'd <hi>Samaria.</hi> He had great debates with the Pharisees; and was much more Favourable to the Sadduces; Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the People Revolted, but were quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to Obedience. He is said to have Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesy'd that his two Elder Sons would quickly be possess'd of the Government. He was Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated, for being at once a Prince, a Priest, and a Prophet. He died in the 31 Year of his Reign, 104 Years before Christ, the last Year of the 160 Olympiad, <hi>A. M.</hi> 3899.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Since I have mention'd the Pharisees, I reckon 'twill not be improper to give some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the different Sects of the Jews. The first mention that <hi>Josephus</hi> makes of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, is in the 9th Chap. of the 13 Book of his <hi>Archaeologia.</hi> 'Tis not to be doubted, but that those Sects were reviv'd after their return from Babylon. Some were of the Opinion, that they ought not to depart from the Letter of the Law; Those were call'd <hi>Karraim.</hi> Others thought it their Duty to add other Voluntary Performances, and were therefore call'd <hi>Hasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dim</hi> or <hi>Saints.</hi> Out of this Sect, there Rose yet another, that were reckon'd much holyer than the other <hi>Hasideans,</hi> and by Reason of their Separation were call'd <hi>Peruschim</hi> or <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruschim,</hi> and by the <hi>Grecians Pharisees.</hi> Now, as the <hi>Pharisees</hi> sprung from the <hi>Hasidim,</hi> so the Sadduces ow'd their Original to the <hi>Karraei,</hi> and took their Name from <hi>Sadoc. Antigonus</hi> the preceptor of <hi>Sadoc,</hi> and the Disciple of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:136207:211"/> Justus,</hi> Taught, that we ought not to serve God, like Mercenary Servants that work for a Reward; meaning, that the Principle of our Duty should be Love, and not the hopes of a Reward.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But <hi>Sadoc</hi> (or <hi>Saiduc</hi>) and <hi>Baithus</hi> wrested this Pious Opinion to an ill meaning, as if they expected no Future Reward, and denied a Future State. This was the Original of that heresy, according to the <hi>Rabbi Abraham.</hi> But <hi>Montacutius</hi> our Countryman brands that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count as Fabulous, and derives the word <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces</hi> from <hi>Sader, Justitia.</hi> There was a Third Sect that took rise from the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> call'd <hi>Essaei</hi> or <hi>Esseni;</hi> but we are at a loss where to fix its first date. Some are of the Opinion; they were call'd <hi>Essaei</hi> from <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or from the <hi>Syrian</hi> word <hi>Haesi,</hi> from whence the Greek word is deriv'd. Now the Hebrew word sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies those who live retir'd from all Noise, which quadrates admirably with the <hi>Essaei,</hi> who affected a <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Silence, and retreated to remote Solitary Villages. Others derive their Name from <hi>Asa,</hi> a Hebrew word that signifies to <hi>heal,</hi> because they studied Physick. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this Sect was Posteriour to the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and accounted holyer; and seems to have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken its rise about this Time, when the <hi>Hyrca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Sadduces retir'd to a desert, in order to avoid the anger and envy of the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. However <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> left 5 Sons; the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of whom was sirnam'd <hi>Aristobulus Philel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> and Succeeded his Father. He converted the Principality into a Kingdom, and put on
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:136207:212"/> the Regal Diadem, about 481 Years after the return of the Jews from <hi>Babylon.</hi> He starv'd his Mother to Death, who was sharer with him in the Government, and slew one of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, the rest being kept up by his Wife. He subdued the <hi>Ituraei,</hi> and oblig'd 'em to comply with the Jewish Rites; and in the space of one Year ended his days in great Trouble of Mind. <hi>Jannaeus</hi> or <hi>Alexander</hi> his Brother suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him, and slew one of his Brethren for raising Sedition. Having settled his Affairs at home, he besieg'd <hi>Ptolomais,</hi> but was routted by <hi>Ptolomaeus Lathurus,</hi> who invaded <hi>Judea.</hi> But after all, <hi>Cleopatra</hi> oblig'd her Son <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> to make Peace with <hi>Alexander,</hi> and proceed no further.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. After the departure of <hi>Lathurus, Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> invaded <hi>Caelosyria</hi> once more, and carryed several Places, and levell'd <hi>Gaza</hi> with the Ground, which was betray'd into his hands. In a fight with the <hi>Arabs,</hi> he lost almost his whole Army, and narrowly escap'd to <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> where his Subjects Rebell'd and made War with him; but at last were master'd and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely punish'd. He enlarged his Dominions by considerable accessions in <hi>Syria, Phaenicia, Idumaea,</hi> and other Countries; Where he pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd himself of a great Number of Cities most of which are mention'd by <hi>Josephus.</hi> At last by a fit of drinking he was thrown into a Quartan feaver, which continued upon him Three Years; but notwithstanding his illness he did not Neglect his concerns, till at the siege of <hi>Ragola</hi> in the Country of the <hi>Geraseni,</hi> it master'd him and put an end to his days, in the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:136207:212"/> 27 Year of his Reign, the 49 of his Age, the 3 of the 173 Olympiad, 76 Years before the Birth of Christ, A. M. 3927.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. When he was upon the point of Death, he advis'd his Wife <hi>Alexandra</hi> not to publish his Death, till she had taken the Castle; and after that to return in Triumph to <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and deliver his Corpse to the <hi>Pharisees</hi> to be treated with what Indignities they pleas'd; and to give ear to their Counsel; because he and his Father had lost the good will of their People by quarreling with the <hi>Pharisees. Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andra</hi> following this Scheme Ingratiated her self with the <hi>Pharisees.</hi> Her Husband left her the Kingdom, notwithstanding that he had two Sons by her, namely <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> and <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus.</hi> But the <hi>Pharisees</hi> were so indiscreet and over-forward in persecuting their adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that a Rebellion ensued, and <hi>Aristobulus</hi> made use of the Opportunity of aspiring to the Crown, and acordingly took upon him the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Title, his Mother being then sick. The illness she was then under, quickly took her off in the 9 Year of her reign and 73 of her age. She was a Woman of matchless Wisdom, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and Application.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> was invested with the Priesthood in the 3 Year of the 177 Olympiad, in the Consulship of <hi>Q. Hortensius</hi> and <hi>Q. Metellus Creticus.</hi> But was routed and outted of his Kingdom by his Brother in a battel fought near <hi>Jordan.</hi> Then he retreated to a Private Life, and oblig'd himself by an Oath to lye still; but <hi>Antipater,</hi> Governour of <hi>Idumaea,</hi> rous'd him from his lazyness, and for fear of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>'s
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:136207:213"/> Power, perswaded him to flee to <hi>Aretas</hi> King of <hi>Arabia. Aretas</hi> was easily induc'd to invade <hi>Judea;</hi> and accordingly laid siege to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> but was repuls'd by <hi>Scaurus</hi> the Treasurer of <hi>Pompey</hi> the Great, whom <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus</hi> had brib'd for that purpose with 400 Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Soon after, each of 'em sent Ambassadors to <hi>Pompey,</hi> who was then at <hi>Damascus;</hi> but the Jews wanted to be rid of the Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and laid heavy charges against 'em both. <hi>Pompey</hi> was Favourable to <hi>Hyrcanus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing disoblig'd by the Violent Measures of <hi>Aristobulus;</hi> and by reason that he found him carrying on his Projects after the interview, pursued him to <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and laid a siege to the Temple where his Friends took Shelter, tho' <hi>Aristobulus</hi> himself return'd to <hi>Pompey.</hi> The Temple was taken by <hi>Pompey</hi> in the Third Month, on the Day of the fast Celebrated in Memory of the Wheel which <hi>Jehojakim</hi> burnt, in the 179 Olympiad, 62 Years before Christ, A. M. 3942, in the Consulship of <hi>C. Antonius</hi> and <hi>M. Tullius Cicero.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. <hi>Pompey</hi> Reinstated <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> in the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Principality; but upon Conditon, that he should not meddle with the <hi>Regalia.</hi> He put to Death the Authors of the Rebellion, and made the Jews Tributary to the People of <hi>Rome.</hi> He took from 'em the Cities they pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd in <hi>Caelosyria;</hi> and set a Governor over them, and carried off <hi>Aristobulus.</hi> Thus was that Nation confin'd within its own Boundaries, which had been so lately Transported with their Victories. Vpon the Journey to <hi>Rome, Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:136207:213"/> the Son of <hi>Aristobulus</hi> gave his keepers the slip and return'd to <hi>Judea;</hi> Where he drew together a body of Men, and attack'd <hi>Gabinius</hi> who defeated him and took him prisoner. Nay, <hi>Aristobulus</hi> himself fled from <hi>Rome,</hi> and retir'd to <hi>Judea,</hi> where he reviv'd the same War; but was equally unfortunate, for <hi>Gabinius</hi> took him Prisoner and sent him back to <hi>Rome. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> got his Liberty, and in another battel lost his Army. <hi>Crassus</hi> succeeded <hi>Gabinius;</hi> And as he passed thro' <hi>Judea</hi> on his Journey to <hi>Parthia</hi> Rob'd the Temple of 20000 Talents; but was soon after punish'd for his Sacrilege by the Circumvention of his Enemies.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. <hi>Caesar,</hi> having drove <hi>Pompey</hi> and the <hi>Senate</hi> out of <hi>Italy,</hi> sent <hi>Aristobulus</hi> at the head of two Legions to subdue <hi>Syria:</hi> But <hi>Pompey</hi>'s faction got him poyson'd on his Journey, and his Corpse lay long above Ground. Soon after <hi>Alexander</hi> was beheaded by <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Orders. About this Time <hi>Antipater</hi> Governour of <hi>Idu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maea</hi> was much Redoubted and Fortified by Alliances with several Princes. He had 4 Sons by <hi>Cypris</hi> a Noble <hi>Arabian</hi> Lady, Namely, <hi>Phafaelus, Herod, Josephus,</hi> and <hi>Pherorah;</hi> and sent 'em all into <hi>Arabia,</hi> while he wag'd War with <hi>Aristobulus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. <hi>Antipater</hi> assisted <hi>Caesar</hi> who was then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in the <hi>Alexandrian</hi> War. <hi>Caesar</hi> rewarded him with considerable gifts, besides that of the Stewardship of <hi>Judea.</hi> He confirm'd the Preisthood to <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> who had done him Good Services, and overlook'd all the charges laid against him by <hi>Antigonus</hi> the Son of <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulus;</hi> And allow'd the Walls of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:136207:214"/> be repair'd. <hi>Antipater,</hi> finding <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> to be a dull unactive Man, made <hi>Phasaelus</hi> his Son Governour of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and set <hi>Herod</hi> over <hi>Galilee,</hi> who at that Time according to <hi>Josephus</hi> was not above 17 (or rather 27) Years Old.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. <hi>Herod,</hi> who from his Infancy gave proof of a Noble Spirit, slew <hi>Ezekias</hi> a Famous Robber that infested <hi>Syria,</hi> for which the Jews call'd him to account: He appear'd, but with a guard of Soldiers, and was absolv'd by <hi>Hyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus.</hi> But he took their bringing him to a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al so very ill, that he would have Revenged himself upon the Judges, had not his Father and Brethren disswaded him. Soon after <hi>Cassius</hi> being engag'd in a War with the <hi>Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viri,</hi> came to <hi>Judea;</hi> Where he exacted a Sum of Money. About that time <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipater</hi> was poyson'd by one <hi>Malichus;</hi> and his Sons conceal'd <hi>Malichus</hi>'s Crime, till the Criminal aspiring to the Principality of <hi>Judea,</hi> was, by the order of <hi>Cassius,</hi> brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dign Punishment, both for his Ambition and Parricide.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. <hi>Herod</hi> was the Person that put <hi>Malichus</hi> to Death: For which the Jews Arraign'd him before <hi>Antonius;</hi> but he with a Sum of Money got off, and turn'd every thing to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his Affairs. The <hi>Parthians</hi> having then made themselves Masters of <hi>Syria; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonus</hi> the Son of <hi>Aristobulus</hi> hir'd 'em to Effect his Restoration, for 2000 Talents and 500 Women. Accordingly they laid siege to <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> and when <hi>Hyrcanus</hi> and <hi>Phasaelus</hi> were sent to them upon an Embassy, keep'd 'em Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners.</p>

                     <p n="5">5. After a Few Years the <hi>Romans</hi> Engag'd in a War with the <hi>Tarentins.</hi> The <hi>Tarentins</hi> were descended of the <hi>Parthenii</hi> who settled in that Country when they were expell'd <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta▪</hi> They Roll'd in Luxury and Pride; they attack'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Fleet, they kill'd <hi>L.

But when he weigh'd the Matter seriously, he consider'd that the conquest of the <hi>Romans</hi> was a very difficult at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and thereupon in the next Year sent <hi>Cineas</hi> (a Man of Extraordinary Eloquence) as Ambassador to Sollicit the Senate to make Peace, and enter into a Confederacy with him.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. The Senate was not against the Peace, till <hi>Appius Claudius,</hi> who was then blind and decrepit thro' Age, and had been Consul a Second Time 17 Years before, came into the Court, and Frighted them out of the thoughts of a Confederacy: So great was the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy and Vigour of that Man's Mind, that upon that occasion he was not wanting either in Publick or Private Officers: At the same Time <hi>C. Fabricius Luscinus,</hi> whom <hi>Cicero</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares to <hi>Aristides</hi> the Athenian, did his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try very good Service. He was sent to <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> to Treat about the Ransoming of the Prisoners, and was Sollicited to Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by very large Offers and Promises; but Generously slighted 'em all. Nor was this all. A Deserter came to him, and told him he could poyson the King, but he sent him back prisoner to his Master. <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> obtain'd some Victories over the <hi>Romans;</hi> but they did not avail him, for the <hi>Romans</hi> were still the more animated by their losses. At last the <hi>Sicilians</hi> implor'd his Assistance against the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and he willingly Cross'd
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:136207:220"/> over to the Isle, thinking there to meet with a Fairer Opportunity of carrying on his designs.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. But finding himself disappointed, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to <hi>Italy,</hi> where <hi>Maximus Curius Denta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> Routed him entirely and oblig'd him to Retire to his own Kingdom. The <hi>Romans</hi> purchas'd such Great and Extensive Glory, by the Noise of this Victory, which spread it self far and Wide, that <hi>Ptolomaeus Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> sent Ambassadors to desire a Confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with them. The <hi>Tarentins</hi> finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves unable to carry the Castle in which <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> had left a Garrison, or to obtain Peace from the <hi>Romans;</hi> did, in the 3d Year after <hi>Pyrrhus</hi>'s departure, Court the Assistance of the <hi>Carthaginians;</hi> but that did not avail them so much as to prevent their being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd. For the Castle first surrender'd it self, and soon after the Town came into the hands of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who allow'd the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens to live in Peace, and Levell'd the Walls with the Ground, in the 482 Year after the building of the City, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulship of <hi>L.

                     <p n="4">4. After so many and so Great Disasters at Sea, the Senate Resolv'd not to attempt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing further that way. The next Year <hi>L. Caecilius Metellus</hi> and <hi>Cn. Furius Pacilus</hi> the Consuls, were sent at the head of the Legions: And the first of the two Routed the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> in a bloody battel and kill'd 20000 of their Men, so that they were oblig'd to sue for Peace. Accordingly the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> sent Ambassadors to Treat of Peace and the Ransom of the Prisoners; among whom was <hi>M. Attilius,</hi> who was doom'd to this Sentence, that if he did not obtain their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, he should return to be laid in Chains. But when he came to <hi>Rome</hi> he advis'd the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the contrary, and shew'd them that it was a thing unprecedented among the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans:</hi> And after that, in order to make good his promise to the Enemy, return'd to <hi>Carthage,</hi> where he was quarter'd and tortur'd to the last degree. Some say he was Crucified; <hi>Eutropius</hi> says they us'd all sorts
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:136207:222"/> of Punishments upon him; and others say he was put to Death by being kept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake with various Instruments of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The <hi>Romans</hi> fitted out a Fleet, and besieg'd <hi>Lilybaeum;</hi> but their Navy was soon after shatter'd, and <hi>Amilcar Barcas</hi> the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian</hi> plunder'd <hi>Italy.</hi> After that the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> did not meddle at Sea for Seven Years, till <hi>Amilcar</hi> provok'd 'em to fit out a New Fleet, and try the last turn of Fortune. In this their forlorn attempt, they defeated the Enemy at the <hi>Aegates</hi> Islands so that they were obliged to sue for Peace, and accept of it upon these Terms; <hi>viz.</hi> that that they should quit <hi>Sicily</hi> and all the Isles between it and <hi>Italy;</hi> that they should not make War with the <hi>Syracusans</hi> or their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, that all the Prisoners should be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd up, and 2300 Talents pay'd in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain space of Time. This was the end of the first Punick War after it had lasted 24 Years, 5 Years after <hi>Lilybaeum</hi> was first besieg'd, in the 513 Year after the building of <hi>Rome,</hi> the 4 of the 134 Olympiad, the 6 of <hi>Seleucus Callinicus,</hi> the 6 of <hi>Ptolomaeus Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getes,</hi> the 239 before Christ, A.

                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> desir'd a Peace, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in order to make further Provisions for War; but they quickly fell in with Greater Dangers, than any that the War with the <hi>Romans</hi> could have occasion'd. For the hir'd
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:136207:222"/> Soldiers gather'd into a body, and before they would Separate requir'd more Arrears than the whole Republick was able to pay. They were push'd on by the Suggestions of some Profligate Fellows who rais'd Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in order to get off with Impunity: And a heavy War ensued which they call'd the <hi>Lybian</hi> and <hi>African;</hi> and which they could not get clear off till after Three Years, and that with difficulty. 'Twas then that Experience convinc'd 'em, that no trust should be Repos'd in Mercenary Soldiers drawn up into one body, and that their own Subjects should not be so Cruelly Treated, as they had been formerly.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. In the next Year after the Punick War, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the 514 after the building of the City, the Year preceeding the birth of <hi>Ennius, C. Claudius Centon</hi> and M. <hi>Sempronius Tudita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> being then Consuls, the first Comedies and Tragedies were made by <hi>Andronicus</hi> a Greek Poet, who was call'd <hi>Livius,</hi> from <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius Salinator,</hi> in 160th Year after the Death of <hi>Sophocles</hi> and <hi>Eurypedes.</hi> Before the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Comedies and Tragedies Satyrs were in use among the <hi>Romans,</hi> and before the Introduction of Satyrs the Verses usual among them were those call'd <hi>Fescennini.</hi> In the 4 Year after this, the Secular Games were Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated a Third Time; they were call'd the <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Terentine</hi> Games from <hi>Terentum</hi> a place in the <hi>Campus Martius</hi> where <hi>Manius Valesius</hi> did first Celebrate the same. In the mean time it is observ'd that all <hi>Secular Games</hi> were call'd <hi>Terentini,</hi> but all the <hi>Teren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tini</hi>
                        <pb n="86" facs="tcp:136207:223"/> were not <hi>Secular;</hi> or else there were two sorts of <hi>Secular Games,</hi> one the <hi>Greater</hi> which were Celebrated every 110 Years, and the other the <hi>Lesser,</hi> which were Celebrated every 100 Years, of which more at large in our larger History.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. In the 6th Year after the Punick War, the Temple of <hi>Janus</hi> was shut a Second Time, for <hi>Titus Manlius Torquatus</hi> had lately conquer'd <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> were alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether free from War. The next Year, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the 520 after the building of the City, <hi>Sp. Carvilius Ruga</hi> divorc'd his Wife which was the first divorce that happen'd in <hi>Rome. Carvilius</hi> pleaded that he did it in order to have Children by another Woman; but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Plausible Plea, the People Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented it with a great deal of Displeasure and Hatred. In the same Year <hi>M. Porcius</hi> was born in the confines of <hi>Tusculum;</hi> he was call'd <hi>Catus</hi> and diminutively <hi>Catulus</hi> with Allusion to his Sagacity and Parts. The same Year, <hi>Cn. Naevius,</hi> who wrote the first Punick War in <hi>Saturnian</hi> Verses, Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd Fables to the People. 30 Years after that, he died having made his own Epitaph himself, with Arrogance enough, which <hi>Gellius</hi> takes notice of together with those of <hi>Plautus</hi> and <hi>Pacuvius.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="9">9. After 6 Years a War broke out with the Illyrians, and the Temple of <hi>Janus</hi> was open'd. <hi>Teuta</hi> the Queen of the Illyrians, and Widow of <hi>Agron</hi> who had thrown him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into a Mortal <hi>Pleurisie</hi> by hard Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, gave her Subjects the Liberty of Pirat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:136207:223"/> accordingly they took <hi>Phenice</hi> a Town of <hi>Epirus,</hi> and Robb'd the <hi>Italian</hi> Merchants. Now the Queen was so far from Remedying the Disorder, that she order'd one of their Ambassadors to be kill'd for discoursing the point freely with her. Whereupon War was declar'd against her, which <hi>Fulvius</hi> the Consul carried on so Dexterously, that the Cities of <hi>Illyricum</hi> were either surrender'd or storm'd, and <hi>Teuta</hi> was put to flight, who sued for Peace, and obtain'd it upon these Terms, <hi>viz.</hi> that she should pay a Yearly Tribute, that she should quit all <hi>Illyricum</hi> excepting a few Places, and that she should not sail be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the River <hi>Orissus</hi> with more than 2 barks and those unarm'd.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The <hi>Illyrians</hi> continu'd their allegiance for 9 Years, till the 535th Year after the Building of the City; in which they revolted, and were subdu'd by <hi>Aemilius Paulus</hi> and <hi>Marcus Livicus</hi> then consuls, and <hi>Demetrius Pharius,</hi> who had usurp'd the Kingdom, was outted, and a certain Sum of Mony was laid upon the People to be pay'd Yearly to <hi>Pineus</hi> the son of <hi>Agron.</hi> This was the end of the War with <hi>Teuta,</hi> which <hi>Florus</hi> pursuant to his usual custom misplaces in bringing it in after the <hi>Gallick Cisalpine</hi> War. For in the very Year in which Peace was concluded upon, with <hi>Teuta; C. Flaminius</hi> the tribune of the People mov'd that a Law should be made adjudging the Land of the <hi>Cisalpine Gauls</hi> to be distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among the People; upon which they were so incens'd that they resolv'd to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe all extremities, rather than be outed of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:136207:224"/> their seats and banish'd their Country. This War happen'd, in the 526th Year after the Building of the City (not the 522d as <hi>Polybius</hi> writes) when <hi>Q. Fabius Maximus</hi> and <hi>Sp. Carvilius Maximus,</hi> were both of 'em a Second time consuls.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. The <hi>Gauls</hi> call'd in the <hi>Insubres</hi> to their assistance, who brought in the other <hi>Transal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine Gauls</hi> upon the <hi>Rhosne,</hi> who were call'd <hi>Gesatae,</hi> upon the Foot of a national War. Presently 50000 Foot and 20000 Horse made an irruption into <hi>Tuscany.</hi> Upon the News of the invasion, <hi>Rome</hi> was Thunderstruck with fear and grief, for they look'd upon the <hi>Gauls</hi> as their fatal Enemies. Then Lists were taken of all those that were fit for War, and all the <hi>Italians</hi> made such preparations for the War in which not only the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, but their own Houses and Families were in Danger; that with incredible ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition they drew together an Army of 700000 Foot and 70000 Horse. Thus writes <hi>Polybius;</hi> but <hi>Fabius Pictor</hi> who was then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent says the <hi>Romans</hi> had 880000 Men in Arms.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. The Roman Generals surpris'd the <hi>Gauls</hi> when they were putting all to Fire and Sword in <hi>Tuscany,</hi> and engag'd them on all sides. And the <hi>Gesatae,</hi> whose Bodies were Naked and expos'd, immediately fled and disorder'd the rest. In this encounter there were 40000 <hi>Gauls</hi> kill'd and 10000 taken Prisoners, among whom was <hi>Concolitanus</hi> the King, the other King, namely <hi>Averoestus,</hi> having laid Violent hands on himself. Upon this disaster the <hi>Gauls</hi> desired a Peace; but
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:136207:224"/>
                        <hi>M. Claudius Marcellus</hi> and <hi>Cn. Cornelius Scipio,</hi> being consuls for the next Year, oppos'd them, as designing to reserve to themselves the Glory of carrying the War further.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. Accordingly the consuls besieg'd <hi>Acerrae</hi> in the Country of the <hi>Insubres,</hi> and the <hi>Gauls</hi> laid siege to <hi>Clastidium,</hi> where they came to a Hot Engagement, and were sadly maul'd <hi>Marcellus</hi> having kill'd <hi>Dardomaras</hi> the <hi>Gesatian</hi> King was the Third Man that brought off the <hi>Opima Spolia,</hi> which he consecrated to <hi>Jupiter Feretrius,</hi> notwithstanding that <hi>Numa</hi> had ordered them to be consecrated to <hi>Quirinus.</hi> The triumphal motto imply'd that the <hi>Germans</hi> together with the <hi>Galli Insubres</hi> were conquer'd, so that it seems the <hi>Gesatae</hi> were call'd <hi>Germani</hi> by some mistake. Some alledge they were call'd <hi>Gesatae,</hi> from a particular sort of Dart us'd among them, because in the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Language, their Name was <hi>Gaests,</hi> that is <hi>Geusts,</hi> for they serv'd upon Pay. Thus was that War brought to an end after 6 Years.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. The Second Punick War begun 3 Years after the <hi>Gallick</hi> War. <hi>Hannibal</hi> the Son of <hi>Amilcar Barcas</hi> was made <hi>Carthaginian</hi> General: When he was 9 Years of age his Father took him along with him into <hi>Spain,</hi> and bound him by an Oath upon a Sacrifice never to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend the <hi>Romans. Hannibal</hi> subdu'd all <hi>Spain</hi> on the other side of the River <hi>Iber</hi> excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Saguntum.</hi> The <hi>Saguntians</hi> acquainted their <hi>Allies</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> with the Progress he he had made; and thereupon Ambassadors were sent but they cou'd not diswade him from attacking <hi>Saguntum.</hi> For he saw very
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:136207:225"/> well thro' their design, <hi>viz.</hi> that they hop'd to make that place the Seat of the War, and so keep it at some distance, to the end that <hi>Italy,</hi> might be secur'd, and they might have leisure to get clear of the <hi>Illyrians.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="15">15. The <hi>Saguntians</hi> endur'd all sort of extremities, and shew'd in themselves a Noble instance of valor and constancy; but at last it was taken. Then the <hi>Romans</hi> sent Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors to Carthage, to demand <hi>Hannibal</hi> as being Guilty of Violating the league, and in case the demand was not satisfied, to declare War, which accordingly was declar'd and accepted. So that the 2d <hi>Punick</hi> War com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menc'd in the 536th Year after the building of the City, the 6th of <hi>Antiochus Magnus,</hi> the 5th of <hi>Ptolomaeus Philopator,</hi> in the 24th Year after the conclusion of the Peace, in the Consulship of <hi>P. Cornelius Scipio,</hi> and <hi>Tib. Sempronius Longus.</hi> This War is describ'd by <hi>Polybius,</hi> from whom <hi>Livy</hi> Copied out the 23d Book of his History, almost word for word.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. <hi>Hannibal</hi> in the 26th Year of his Age, having subdued all <hi>Spain,</hi> March'd thro' <hi>France</hi> at the Head of 50000 Foot and 9000 Horse, and cross'd the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and in the 5th Month arriv'd in <hi>Italy,</hi> having left <hi>Hanno</hi> to Guard the upper Countries. Upon his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney he lost a great part of his Army, the number being reduc'd to 18200 Foot and 6000 Horse. He routed <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Sempronius</hi> the Consuls upon the <hi>Ticinus</hi> and <hi>Trebbias,</hi> and afterwards <hi>Flaminius</hi> at the Lake <hi>Thrasimenus.</hi> These disasters put the People of <hi>Rome</hi> into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:136207:225"/> whereupon they nominated <hi>Q. Fabius Maximus</hi> to be Vice-dictator, the consul being then absent so that a dictator could not be nominated. <hi>Fabius</hi> by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying and putting off, put a stop to the Violence and fury of the Enemy, but upon his return met with a sorry reception from the <hi>Tribunes</hi> and some others, who were Angry with him for protracting the War. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they took occasion to make <hi>Terentius Varro</hi> Consul; Who was an imprudent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Man, and in Spite of the remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strances of the Wise <hi>L. Aemilius Paulus</hi> his colleague, would needs engage <hi>Hannibal</hi> at <hi>Cannae,</hi> where the <hi>Roman</hi> Army was almost to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally cut off.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. This defeat occasion'd such a conster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the City, that the richer Citizens thought of Fleeing and departing <hi>Italy,</hi> but <hi>P. Cornelius Scipio,</hi> Son to <hi>P.</hi> a Youth of a brave Spirit, who was then scarce 24 Years of Age, encourag'd 'em to stay. Nay all the estates gather'd into a Body, and went out to meet <hi>Varro</hi> the Author of the defeat, and thank'd him for gathering up the scatter'd remnant of the forces, and not despairing of the state of the Republick.</p>
                     <p n="18">18. Had <hi>Hannibal</hi> march'd straight to <hi>Rome,</hi> he might easily have storm'd the Castle of the War, and so made an end of his business. But, as <hi>Maherbal</hi> the General Major of the Horse did not stand to tell him, he knew how to obtain a Victory but did not know how to use it. For he led his Army to <hi>Capua,</hi> where he suffer'd 'em to be debauch'd and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:136207:226"/> enervated by Luxury and the redundancy of all necessaries: insomuch that the saying was not a miss, <hi>viz. <hi>Capua</hi>
                        </hi> was a <hi>Cannee</hi> to <hi>Hannibal.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="19">19. While <hi>Hannibal</hi> was thus negligent of his concerns, the <hi>Romans</hi> took courage, and the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> interest began to decline. <hi>Hannibal</hi> himself was oblig'd to break up the Siege of <hi>Cumae,</hi> and to retire from before <hi>Nola.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> acted successfully in <hi>Spain, Sicily</hi> and <hi>Sardinia.</hi> In <hi>Sicily</hi> M. <hi>Claudius Marcellus</hi> Besieged <hi>Syracusae;</hi> for after <hi>Hiero</hi> died in the 90th Year of his Age, the <hi>Syrcacusans</hi> had revolted from the <hi>Romans.</hi> However they stood out a long while by Vertue of the Machines which <hi>Archimedes</hi> the Famous Mathematician made to keep off the Enemy. At last after a 3 Years Siege the <hi>Romans</hi> master'd the City at a time when the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens were careless; and among others <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi> himself was kill'd, who was so taken up with writing some things in the sand, that he was not sensible that his country was in the hands of its Enemy.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. <hi>Marcellus</hi> lamented his Death so soon as he knew of it, and order'd him to be bury'd. <hi>Cicero</hi> says he not only spar'd the Town, but adorn'd it, insomuch that he left it at once a Monument of his Victory Meekness and Clemency: but <hi>Livy</hi> says that he acted a great many ugly things, as being instances of extreme Anger and Peevishness. At the same time the <hi>Scipio</hi>'s, designing unseasonably to put an end to the <hi>Spanish</hi> War, divided their forces; and were cut off, together with almost
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:136207:226"/> the whole Army by the <hi>Celtiberi.</hi> But their Death was handsomely resented by <hi>L. Martius</hi> the General, who took the like occasion of attacking the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> when they were divided and secure, and routed 'em to that degree, that 37000 of 'em were kill'd, 1830 taken prisoners, and a great booty carried off.</p>
                     <p n="21">21. In <hi>Italy</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> besig'd <hi>Capua,</hi> and <hi>Hannibal</hi> fruitlessly attack'd the Castle of <hi>Tarentum;</hi> but finding himself unable to raise the Siege of <hi>Capua,</hi> march'd towards <hi>Rome</hi> it self, where Thunder and Lightning pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented an Engagement; so that he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd much of himself and his hard For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and return'd to <hi>Rhegium.</hi> By this means the Campanians were depriv'd of all hopes of relief, and <hi>Capua</hi> was surrender'd to the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="22">22. It was Warmly and Tediously disput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whether the Town should be destroyed or not: But after a long debate they agree'd to preserve it: but in order to prevent any possibility of their Future Rebellion, they were depriv'd of their Land, Magistrates, Senate, and Publick Councils, without leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it the Face of a Republick; and 'twas appointed to be a place for buying and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving of Fruits, a Receptacle of Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and a Magazine for the product of the Campanian Ground.

Livius Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linator</hi> and <hi>C. Claudius Nero</hi> at the River <hi>Metaurus.</hi> But <hi>Hannibal</hi> was Ignorant of what happen'd: For tho' <hi>Nero</hi> was Encamp'd just over against him, yet he was not sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that he had march'd off, to the Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his Colleague, till the Consul Return'd and threw <hi>Asdrubals</hi> Head into the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian</hi> Camp.</p>
                     <p n="25">25. In the mean Time <hi>P. Scipio</hi> went on successfully in <hi>Spain,</hi> where his Father and Uncle had lost their Lives before. After he had Recover'd the whole Province he Return'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> and being made Consul desir'd of the <hi>Senate</hi> that <hi>Africa</hi> should be allotted to him for his Province, to the End that he might carry the War into their own Territories. Q. <hi>Fabius Maximus,</hi> an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:136207:229"/> Gentleman, was mightily against the motion; his Opinion was that it was not proper to go to <hi>Africa</hi> but to fight <hi>Hannibal</hi> where he was. On the other hand <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Plea was, that if the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were attack'd within their own Territories, they wou'd be oblig'd to recall <hi>Hannibal</hi> from <hi>Italy,</hi> since their hopes and Security were founded upon him. After a long Debate the <hi>Senate</hi> allots <hi>Sicily</hi> to <hi>Scipio,</hi> and allows him to Cross over to <hi>Africa,</hi> if the Interest of the Republick requir'd it.</p>
                     <p n="26">26. Next Year <hi>Scipio</hi> went from <hi>Sicily</hi> into <hi>Africa,</hi> and made good his promise to the <hi>Senate;</hi> for he defeated the <hi>Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> several Times, and maul'd 'em so much, that they Recall'd <hi>Hannibal.</hi> So that he who had Rang'd over <hi>Italy</hi> full 16 Years, and had pitch'd his Camp under the Walls of <hi>Rome,</hi> was oblig'd to return home, tho' un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing and full of sorrow; and afterwards being routed by <hi>Scipio</hi> advis'd the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> to ask a Peace. <hi>Scipio</hi> was very much concern'd for Fear the Consuls of this Year, who had an Eye upon <hi>Africa,</hi> should rob him of the Glory of concluding the War.</p>
                     <p n="27">27. A Peace therefore was concluded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by the Consent of the <hi>Senate,</hi> upon these Terms; <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> should enjoy their Liberty and their <hi>African</hi> lands; but should quit <hi>Spain</hi> and all the Isles of the Mediterranean Sea that ever were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted; that they should deliver up all the Deserters, all their Ships bating 10 Galleys, all their Tame Elephants, and shou'd Tame
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:136207:230"/> no Elephants for the Future; that they shou'd Wage War with none without the consent of the People of <hi>Rome;</hi> that they shou'd restore all to <hi>Massanissa</hi> King of <hi>Numi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> and enter into a Confederacy with him; that in the space of 50 Years they should pay 1000 Talents of Silver, and pawn 100 Hostages for Security. Thus was the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Punick War brought to an end after 18 Years, and from thence <hi>Scipio</hi> was Sirnam'd <hi>Africanus.</hi>

The <hi>Romans</hi> taking these motions into their Consideration, began to entertain some Jealousies of him, which were further Enflam'd by <hi>Hannibals</hi>'s proceedings.

About that time the the <hi>Romans</hi> wag'd War with the <hi>Galati</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Manlius</hi> the consul, and his Army upon their return brought home the first seeds of Luxury to the City.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. After 3 Years <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign'd of cheating the State, by impropriating the spoil taken in War; and the <hi>Tribunes</hi> appointed a day for his Trial. This great Man who had done so many and such great services to the publick, was afraid to stand Trial, and having forbid the Court, went up to the Capitol to return thanks to the <hi>Gods</hi> for his Victory; and then retir'd to <hi>Linternum,</hi> where he dy'd in the 4th Year of his exile, in the same Year that <hi>Philopaemenes</hi> the <hi>Achaian</hi> General died, as also <hi>Hannibal</hi> himself who had fled to <hi>Prusias</hi> King of <hi>Bithynia.</hi> For <hi>Philopaemenes</hi> being taken by the <hi>Messenians</hi> was constrain'd to take a Draught of Poyson: and <hi>Hannibal</hi> finding that <hi>Quintius</hi> demanded him; and that it was not possible for him to escape, kill'd himself with Poyson that he carried in his Ring.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 About the same time <hi>L. Scipio</hi> (who from his Victory over <hi>Antiochus</hi> was Sirnam'd <hi>Asiaticus</hi>) was likewise charg'd with cheating the State. Next Year the wicked misteries of the <hi>Bacchanalia</hi> were brought to light, by which many were offer'd up as sacrifices, and several other Monstrous Crimes were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Afterwards a War broke out with he <hi>Ligurians▪</hi> and <hi>Corsica</hi> was subdued. Soon
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:136207:231"/> after, the Second <hi>Macedonian</hi> War or that with <hi>Perseus,</hi> commenc'd in the 583th Year of the City, 24 Years after the conclusion of the Peace with <hi>Philip,</hi> and 17 after that with <hi>Antiochus.</hi>

                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Philip</hi> King <hi>Macedonia</hi> had taken it very ill that the <hi>Romans</hi> shou'd pinch him so much, and design'd to revive the War: but Death prevented him, and <hi>Perseus</hi> his Son succeeded. <hi>Perseus</hi> had formerly been disoblig'd by the <hi>Romans</hi> and willingly embrac'd the War, as part of his heritage. But <hi>L. Aemilius Paulus</hi> in his Second Consulship, defeated him and took him Prisoner, together with his Wife, Mother, and Children; and led them in triumph, from whence he was Sirnam'd <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonicus.</hi> At that time <hi>Macedonia</hi> became a <hi>Roman</hi> Province, as I intimated above, in the 586th Year of the City, in the Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of <hi>L.

                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. Soon after, one <hi>Andriscus,</hi> of a mean descent, gave himself out for the Son of <hi>Perseus</hi> and declar'd War against the <hi>Romans,</hi> but being routed by <hi>Q. Metellus</hi> the <hi>Praetor,</hi> fled to <hi>Byzus</hi> King of <hi>Thrace,</hi> who deliver'd him up. At last the 3d Punick War broke out; for the <hi>Romans</hi> took hold of any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of Quarrelling with the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> Indeed the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> cou'd not sit with Idleness, but started disputes concerning the property of some Neighbouring Lands, and had thereupon declar'd War against a'most all their Neighoeurs, especially <hi>Massanissa</hi> King of <hi>Numidia,</hi> who was an <hi>Allie</hi> of the People
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:136207:232"/> of <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> being chosen Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tors were partial to the King, and upon <hi>Massanissa</hi>'s sollicitation declar'd War against <hi>Carthage.</hi> But were divided in their Opinions, whether the City should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd or preserv'd.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Some were of Opinion that they shou'd not destroy it, by reason that if <hi>Carthage</hi> were out of the way, civil and domestick feuds, wou'd prevail amongst them. But <hi>M. Porcius Cato</hi> was of another Opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Republick of <hi>Rome</hi> wou'd ever be in Danger, if that City were not totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd; and this Opinion was most approved of. But <hi>Cato</hi> himself being then 85 Yea'rs of Age dy'd while they were yet debating the point. <hi>Cicero</hi> lists him among the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient orators, and places him next to <hi>M.

Among many other injunctions, given by the <hi>Romans</hi> to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> this was one that they shou'd abandon the City, and build another if they pleas'd at 10 Miles distance from the Sea. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were resolv'd to undergo the last extremity rather than comply with so hard a precept. Several consuls were imploy'd against 'em; at last the business of destroying <hi>Carthage</hi> was committed to the care of <hi>P. Scipio Aemilianus,</hi> Son to <hi>P.

                     <p n="3">3. About the same time the Slaves in <hi>Sicily</hi> revolted, and gather'd a great body of forces, and it was with some difficulty that <hi>P. Rutilus Nepos</hi> the Consul quell'd 'em. Hitherto the singular Modesty and Vertue of the <hi>Roman</hi> Generals, and the Formidable Power of the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> had so over-aw'd the People, that all their feuds and Differences never went to the height of blood or Slaughter. But now the <hi>Asiatick</hi> Triumphs tainted them with so much Security and Luxury, that envy, feuds, factions, and privat Hatred gradually prevail'd upon them, and at length broke out into civil Wars.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. For in the foremention'd Year, at the same time that <hi>Numantia</hi> was subdued by <hi>Scipio, Tib. Sempronius,</hi> Tribune of the People,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:136207:233"/> occasion'd great disorders in the City by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Law prohibiting any Man to possess above 500 Acres of publick Land, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judging the overplus to be equally distributed among the Poor. The Noblemen were mightily incens'd at this Law; but he propos'd yet another, adjudging all the Mony left by <hi>Attalus</hi> King of <hi>Pergamus.</hi> by way of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy to the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be distributed in like manner. This Juncture stagger'd the <hi>Senate,</hi> insomuch that they did not see how to get rid of the difficulties that attended it. But <hi>Scipio Nasica</hi> calling upon every one that ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the good of the Republick to follow him, went up to the Capitol, and slew <hi>Grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> when haranguing to the People, together with many others. This was the first Blood that was shed in <hi>Rome</hi> thro' Sedition, and the source of their Civil Wars.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. At the same Time the <hi>Romans</hi> were En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in a War with <hi>Aristobulus</hi> in <hi>Asia,</hi> who being the Bastard Brother of <hi>Attalus</hi> the King of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> that left the People of <hi>Rome</hi> his heir, possess'd himself of the Kingdom, and Defrauded the <hi>Romans</hi> of their Legacy. But M. <hi>Perpenna</hi> the Consul Defeated him, and having block'd him up in <hi>Stratonice,</hi> took him Prisoner; and <hi>Aquilus</hi> carry'd him to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he was strangl'd in Prison. Next Year being the 626 after the building of the City, <hi>Paulus Scipio Africanus minor</hi> having seem'd to Rub hard upon the People in the <hi>Lex Agraria,</hi> was kill'd in the night time as he lay a bed in his own House, and that by his own Relations; as it was believ'd; and was

                     <p n="6">6. About 12 Years after the Murder of <hi>Tiberius Gracchus,</hi> his Brother <hi>Caius</hi> underwent the same fate. For being made Tribune of the People, he not only Justify'd the <hi>Lex A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graria</hi> with a great deal of Warmth, but Transferr'd the right of Publick Judgment from the <hi>Senatours</hi> to the <hi>Equites,</hi> who now began to appear in a Distinct Rank, which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards brightned by the care and glory of <hi>Cicero.</hi> Besides <hi>Caius</hi> being frustrated in his design of carrying a Colony to <hi>Carthage,</hi> Return'd to the City and Endeavor'd to sow a New Sedition among the People; but <hi>Opimius</hi> the Consul with his Friends fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him and kill'd him in the attempt. But his head was not at all sacred as <hi>Florus</hi> writes, for he had laid down the Tribune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship before he was kill'd. <hi>Cicero</hi> crys up both the Brethren for Eloquence, but especially <hi>Caius,</hi> whom he gives out for the most Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and Eloquent of all the <hi>Romans,</hi> and whose Orations he advises the Youth to peruse, as being proper not only to what, but to feed and nourish their Minds.</p>

Apuleius Saturninus,</hi> whom the <hi>Senat</hi> had remov'd from being Treasurer, took occasion to resent the affront, (being made Tribune of the People) by starting new Mutinies upon the <hi>Lex Agraria.</hi> But the Consuls took him Prisoner, and the <hi>Equites</hi> fell upon him and his complices, in the very Court, and kill'd 'em. About 8 Years after that, <hi>Drusus</hi> the Tribune, indeavoring to oblige both the <hi>Senators</hi> and the <hi>Equites,</hi> by making a new Law giving to either state the Power of passing Judgments, incur'd the hatred of them both; and when he endeavor'd to promote the <hi>Lex Agraria,</hi> and give the <hi>Italians</hi> the Freedom of the City, was Murder'd by an unknown Hand in the entry of his own House.</p>

This gave rise to such animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities, that a heavy War broke out, which they call'd <hi>Sociale, Marsicum</hi> and <hi>Italicum.</hi> The War continued 2 Years with Various success; till at last the <hi>Italians</hi> were reduc'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd by <hi>Sylla</hi> the Consul, and allow'd the Freedom of the City, in the 666 Year after the building of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of <hi>L.

The <hi>Romans</hi> were so incens'd at this action, that they declar'd War against him, under the conduct of <hi>Q.

                     <p n="4">4. While <hi>Sylla</hi> was absent in <hi>Asia, L. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius Cinna</hi> the Consul began to make a stir, and carry on seditious designs. But <hi>Cn. Octavius</hi> his collegue turn'd him out, and expell'd him the City.

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:136207:236"/> blood and rapine. Then they declar'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Consuls, and display'd a great deal of cruelty in the execution of that Magistracy. <hi>Cinna</hi> gave orders for the Death of M. <hi>Anton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius</hi> an excellent orator; and <hi>Marius</hi> serv'd <hi>Q.

                     <p n="5">5. In the mean Time <hi>Mithridates</hi> slew 80000 <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Italians</hi> in one Day, and made all Necessary Preparations for War. But <hi>Sylla</hi> came into <hi>Greece,</hi> and took <hi>Athens</hi> together with the <hi>Piraeum,</hi> and obtain'd 2 Victories over <hi>Archelaus</hi> the King's Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, so that <hi>Mithridates</hi> was under a Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of desiring a Peace. Accordingly <hi>Sylla</hi> made Peace with the King and so put an End to the War. Then he Return'd into <hi>Italy,</hi> but, a little before his Return, <hi>Marius</hi> being Consul a 7th Time dy'd. After the Death of <hi>Marius, Cn.

                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Sylla</hi> having compass'd his End pursued his Enemies with a great deal of Warmth; and after he had expos'd to Publick view the List of the banish'd Persons, sold their Estates, and depriv'd their Children of any Right to Places of honor and trust. Then he was made perpetual Dictator, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of every thing at Pleasure, and clipp'd the Power of the Tribunes. When he sold the Citizens Estates, he said in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:136207:237"/> Meeting that it was his own spoil that he sold. He was so Inveterate against <hi>C.

After so many and so great exploits, he resign'd the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy and said that he was ready to answer for all he had done. Then he retir'd to the Country to lead an unactive Life, and dy'd at <hi>Puteoli</hi> of the Lousy distepmer.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Q. Sertorius</hi> was one of those who were banish'd; a Man Famous for his Steddyness and Knowledge of War. This Man rais'd a heavy War in upper <hi>Spain,</hi> and defeated several <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Generals, and master'd several Cities. After the defeat of <hi>Metellus,</hi> the Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the War was committed to <hi>Cn.

                     <p n="8">8. In the mean time <hi>Murena</hi> being left in <hi>Asia,</hi> and coveting a Triumph, renew'd the War with <hi>Mithridates</hi> upon slender grounds; but was order'd by <hi>Sylla</hi> to forbear, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Peace was concluded for 3 Years with the King, and his Son of 4 Years of Age was given as an hostage, and part of <hi>Cappadocia</hi> was all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otted
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:136207:237"/> him. 7 Years after that were scarce elaps'd, when the War broke out afresh, and that upon this occasion. <hi>Mithridates</hi> had often desir'd of the <hi>Romans</hi> that their league with him should be engross'd, but finding that his Sollicitations were not regarded, perswaded <hi>Tigranes</hi> King of <hi>Armenia</hi> his Son in Law to invade <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> who carried off 300000 Men from thence and built <hi>Tigranocerta</hi> the Metropolis of that Country; and when he found that he cou'd not obtain a Pardon, enter'd into a league wirh <hi>Sertorius,</hi> and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd himself of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> whose King <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comedes</hi> had made the People of <hi>Rome</hi> his <hi>Heir.</hi>

                     <p n="9">9. In the 680th Year of the City, while <hi>Licinius Lucullus</hi> and M. <hi>Aurelius Cotta</hi> were Consuls, <hi>Lucullus</hi> fell upon the King who was then besieging <hi>Cyzicum,</hi> and having cut off his Army turn'd him out of <hi>Bithynia</hi> and <hi>Paphlagonia,</hi> and oblig'd him to retire to <hi>Pontus,</hi> from whence he fled to <hi>Tigranes. Lucullus</hi> continuing to pursue his Enemy, defeated the joint forces of both the Kings in several Battels; but the <hi>Mutinies</hi> that were cunningly Fomented in his Army, hinder'd him to put an end to the War. For he was recall'd, and the War committed to the care of <hi>Glabrio.</hi> The next Year being the 9th after <hi>Lucullus</hi> had come to that province, it was devolv'd upon <hi>Pompey,</hi> he being strengthen'd by <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi>'s interest, who made a Noble ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue to the People in praise of him.</p>

                        <pb n="112" facs="tcp:136207:238"/>10. While <hi>Lucullus</hi> was carrying on the War in <hi>Pontus,</hi> one <hi>Spartacus</hi> a <hi>Thracian,</hi> a fencer, being joyn'd by 70 more of his own Station, possess'd himself of <hi>Vesuvius</hi> a Hill in <hi>Campania,</hi> and gave a Free reception to all fugitives, and committed Robberies in the Neigbouring places. He routed <hi>Claudius</hi> the <hi>Praetor</hi> and <hi>P. Varinus,</hi> and having drawn together an Army of 70000 Men, had some thoughts of storming <hi>Rome</hi> it self; but M. <hi>Licinius Crassus</hi> the <hi>Praetor</hi> defeated him in a Battel, and brought him to condign Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his ambition. <hi>Pompey</hi> suppress'd the remainder of his forces, when they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to make head again, in the 3d Year before he engag'd in the <hi>Piratick</hi> War.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. A great company of Pirates did so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest the Mediterranean Sea, that neither Sailers nor those who dwelt on the Sea-side were safe. These Pirats were first set up by <hi>Mithridates;</hi> but when Peace was first made with him, the advantage they made by their way of Living mov'd them to continue in it. They consisted of <hi>Syrians, Cyprians Pamphylians</hi> and others, who were call'd <hi>Cilices</hi> beecause they sculk'd in some Creeks of <hi>Cilicia. Murena</hi> and <hi>Servilius</hi> had appear'd against 'em, but to little purpose; for their impudence grew to that height, that they made a descent upon <hi>Italy,</hi> and carry'd off several Noble Ladyes, and, what was yet more Disgraceful to the <hi>Romans,</hi> two Armies together with the Standards.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. Then <hi>Gabinius</hi> Tribune of the People made a Law appointing <hi>Pompey</hi> to make Head against 'em with full power for 3 Years. And
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:136207:238"/> allowing him 500 Ships, 120000 Foot, 5000 Horse, 25 Legats, 2 Treasurers, and 6000 Attick Talents. <hi>Pompey</hi> did so cover the whole Sea, that when one Legate gave chase to the Pirats, the others fell in with 'em so that they cou'd not escape; and himself sail'd up and down like an Emperour of so many Kings, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing the whole work. By his singular diligence and application, he clear'd the Sea in 40 days, and oblig'd all the Pirats to put in to <hi>Cilicia,</hi> where he storm'd their forts, and took almost 400 Ships and 120 Castles, and slew 10000 Men, and so made an end of the War in less than 3 Months time. He carry'd himself civilly enough to the conquer'd, Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners who were Translated to other seats at a considerable distance from the Sea. But <hi>Q. Metellus</hi> was very cruel to those who lurk'd in <hi>Creet;</hi> for <hi>Metellus</hi> subdued that Island, which boasted before that it was never conquer'd; and thereupon got the Sirname of <hi>Creticus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="13">13. When this War was almost at an End, <hi>C. Manilius</hi> Tribune of the People, made a Law, giving to <hi>Pompey</hi> the Command of all the <hi>Roman</hi> Armys, the Province of <hi>Asia,</hi> and the Management of the War with <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates</hi> and <hi>Tigranes;</hi> Notwithstanding all the Grudges of the Noble Men, who took it very ill that the whole <hi>Roman Empire</hi> shou'd without any Precedent be put into the hands of one Man. However <hi>Pompey</hi> put <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridates</hi> to Flight, and took <hi>Tigranes</hi> King of <hi>Armenia,</hi> whom he rais'd from a suppliant and dejected Condition, and set the Diadem upon his head after he had laid it down,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:136207:239"/> adding some few Injunctions for him to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve. He likewise check'd his Villainous Son that had conspir'd against his Father's life, and at last put him to Death. Then he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd the <hi>Itureans</hi> and <hi>Arabians,</hi> and reduc'd <hi>Syria</hi> to the form of a Roman Province.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. <hi>Mithridates</hi> fled to <hi>Colchis</hi> and at last to <hi>Scythia.</hi> But at the same Time that he was projecting great things, and making a descent upon <hi>Italy, Pharnaces</hi> his Son whom he doated much upon debauched the Army from him. When he found himself beset with Unsurmountable Difficulties, and that he cou'd not Reclaim his Son, he laid Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hands on himself. <hi>Cicero</hi> says, he was the Greatest King since <hi>Alexander.</hi> The War with him commenc'd about 20 Years before, when <hi>Cn. Pompeius Strabo</hi> and <hi>L. Porcius Cato</hi> were Consuls; and was put to an end when M. <hi>Tullius Cicero</hi> and <hi>C. Antonius Nepos</hi> were Consuls, in the 691 Year of the City, the 2 of the 179 Olympiad, the 61 before Christ, and the 3942 of the World.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. The News of his Death were brought to <hi>Pompey,</hi> upon his March towards <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> against <hi>Aristobulus.</hi> When <hi>Pompey</hi> had adjusted the Affairs of <hi>Judea, Pontus,</hi> and the other places in the East, 5 Years being spent in the Expedition, he return'd to <hi>Rome</hi> Crown'd with Glory, and Triumph'd for 2 Days together. <hi>L. Catilina</hi> and several others enter'd into a great conspiracy against the Republick; in the same Year that <hi>Mithridates</hi> dy'd, and the Temple of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was taken. This <hi>Catilina</hi> was a Profligate Nobleman,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:136207:239"/> that had spent all his Estate in gratifying his lust, and follow'd this new way of plotting in order to repair his Fortune.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. <hi>Cicero</hi> pump'd the account of the whole Affair out of <hi>Fulvia,</hi> with whom <hi>Catilina</hi> kept Company. After the Crime came to Light by <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Singular Industry, <hi>Catilina</hi> was expell'd the City; then he drew together a body of Profligate Fellows in <hi>Etruria,</hi> and was Routed by <hi>C. Antonius Cicero</hi>'s Collegue in a battel, wherein he fought stoutly and was kill'd. Publick thanks were return'd to <hi>Cicero</hi> for his Diligence and Service in that Affair, and by <hi>Cato</hi>'s interest he was first Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted <hi>Pater Patriae. Cicero</hi> in his Writings frequently crys up the Service he did to his Country on this occasion; but when he speaks of <hi>Catilina</hi>'s <hi>Genius,</hi> he says there never was such a Monster upon Earth, patch'd up of such contrary Humors and Appetites.</p>
                     <p n="17">17. 2 Years afterwards <hi>C.

But his itch for Honour was so precipitant, that he wanted mightily to be made Consul; and for so much as the Sessions of the Consular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention approach'd, desir'd leave to return to the City before his triumph. But that cou'd not be granted to one that desir'd a triumph; so that he preferr'd the Consulship to it, and came to the City, and put himself up for a Candidate.</p>

For <hi>Pompey,</hi> mortally hated the <hi>Magnates,</hi> who favour'd <hi>Lucullus</hi> in every thing. <hi>Lucullus</hi> cry'd out, that he was injur'd, and censur'd <hi>Pompey</hi>'s actions, desiring a rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of what himself had done in the Province. Things being at this pass, <hi>Pompey</hi> was sorry that he had dismiss'd his Army, but since his repentance was too late, struck up with <hi>Caesar,</hi> and assisted him in procuring the Consulship, upon condition that if he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass'd his end, he should ratify what <hi>Pompey</hi> had done.</p>
                     <p n="20">20. <hi>Pompey</hi> and <hi>Crassus</hi> had been at odds from the time of their joint Consulship: but <hi>Caesar</hi> reconcil'd them, and all the 3 conspir'd together to suffer nothing to be done in the <hi>Republick,</hi> that they did not agree to. <hi>Varro</hi> wrote a Book upon the conspiracy, and stil'd it <hi>conspiratio tricipitana.</hi> This was the original of the Civil Wars, for as much as it sunk the Authority of the <hi>Senate</hi> and Noblemen. <hi>Acinius Pollic.</hi> begins his Book of the Civil Feuds, and <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> dates the original of <hi>Caesar</hi>'s greatness from this Year, which was the 694 after the building of the City, the 1 of the 180 <hi>Olympiad,</hi> the 58th before the Birth of Christ, <hi>A.

In order to unite <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> more firmly to his interests, he married his Daughter <hi>Julia</hi> to him. <hi>L. Calpurnius Piso</hi> and <hi>A.

Tho <hi>Clodius</hi> had debauch'd <hi>Caesar's</hi> Wife, he not only forgave the adulterer, but assisted him in procuring the tribuneship, out of spite to <hi>Cicero,</hi> who incessantly rail'd against the Triumviral conspiracy, and by way of a thankfull return, for the good services he had done him in procuring the province of <hi>France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Clodius</hi> being a Nobleman could not be a candidat for the trbuneship; till, in order to be reveng'd upon <hi>Cicero,</hi> who arraign'd him
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:136207:243"/> of adultery with <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Wife, he got him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self adopted by a <hi>Plebeian;</hi> and being by that means made tribune, enacted a Law, entailing banishment upon whoever had given orders for the Death of any <hi>Roman</hi> Citizen, before he was Tried. Then he arraign'd <hi>Cicero,</hi> who by the Senat's consent had kill'd <hi>Cethegus Lentulus</hi> and <hi>Catilina's</hi> other complices, in prison; so that <hi>Cicero</hi> being forsaken by <hi>Pompey</hi> was ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish'd; but before he went off made a haran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue to the People and the <hi>Equites,</hi> in which, 'tis said, he recommended his Family to their care; but that Oration which commonly passes under <hi>Cicero</hi>'s Name, is a taudry impertinent discourse and scarce suited to the Spirit of the Latin Language. Accordingly <hi>Gothofredus</hi> thinks, that whoever attributes that Harangue to <hi>Cicero,</hi> do's, as if he put a coarse and ragged Garment upon the Shoulders of a rich King.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Cicero</hi> being banish'd, <hi>Clodius</hi> had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a spite against <hi>Cato,</hi> and by vertue of a Law for the purpose, sent him to turn <hi>Ptolomy</hi> King of <hi>Cyprus</hi> out of his Kingdom. <hi>Cato</hi> made a large treasure of Mony out of the Estate of the King, who upon approach of the <hi>Roman</hi> General laid violent hands upon himself. However <hi>Clodius</hi> began to twitt the Noblemen, and then <hi>Pompey</hi> repented of his deserting <hi>Cicero;</hi> and sollicited for his return. After 16 Months banishment, <hi>Cicero</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call'd with an universal joy, and made a Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angue to the <hi>Quirites,</hi> in which he return'd thanks to his Friends. Then he charg'd <hi>L. Piso</hi> and <hi>A. Gabinius</hi> with his banishment, and made it out that they betray'd him; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd

                     <p n="6">6. When <hi>Crassus</hi> march'd against the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> the People express'd a great deal of anger, and their Tribunes curs'd him. Upon the Road he pillag'd the Temple of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and committed a great many hainous Crimes: but when he cross'd the <hi>Euphrates</hi> he was beaten, and perfidiously kill'd in an intervew; thus was he brought to condign punishment for his Sacrilege. 'Twas this <hi>Crassus</hi> who was wont to say, that no Man was rich but he that could maintain an Army of 4 Legious upon his own Incomes. While he waged War with the <hi>Parthians, Ptolomaeus Auletes</hi> King of <hi>Egypt</hi> being forced out of his Kingdom by his own Subjects, came to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he stay'd a long while, but could not obtain assistance, because the Sibylline Books seem'd to prohibit the <hi>Romans</hi> to make War in <hi>Egypt.</hi> Then he return'd to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and with a round Sum of Mony engag'd <hi>Gabinius, Ʋnder-Consul</hi> of <hi>Syria</hi> to effect his Restoration. <hi>Gabinius</hi> sav'd his Life by bribing the Judges; but was arraign'd of cheating the State, and banish'd.</p>

                        <pb n="122" facs="tcp:136207:245"/>7. The <hi>Romans,</hi> at this time, were arriv'd at that height of Avarice and Wickedness, that they had quite departed from the measures of their Ancestors; and all their Magistracies eitheir sold, or come at by the means of Scold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Cudgells, Stones, Daggers or Swords. The Consuls were eclyps'd by the Heads of the triumviral Conspiracy; Both the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces and the Administation of Affairs were out of their Hands; so they e'en minded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but enlarging their Estates by selling the Republick. Upon a warm Debate among the Candidates for the Consulship, <hi>T. Annius Milo,</hi> who was one of the Number, slew <hi>Clodius</hi> as he met him upon the Road. <hi>Pompey</hi> was not mov'd with all this: He hop'd to be made <hi>Dictator;</hi> and <hi>Cato</hi> observing that all their Eyes were fix'd upon him, got him made sole Consul; designing thereby to bring him in as accountable for his Actions.</p>
                     <p n="8">8.

However <hi>Milo</hi> was banish'd. The <hi>Gauls</hi> who but lately had been reduc'd, took occasion to rebell again, upon the news of these Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions in the City, and the hopes that <hi>Caesar</hi> would be detain'd in <hi>Italy;</hi> but <hi>Caesar</hi> punish'd 'em again for their boldness. After the conclusion of the <hi>Gallick</hi> War, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd in the 8th Year, the Civil War between <hi>C. Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> broke out.</p>

He thought he was not safe if he quitted the Army; however he made this proposal, that both he and <hi>Pompey</hi> should give up their Armies together; but that being rejected, he march'd with incredible expedition at the Head of his Forces from <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Italy,</hi> and master'd several Towns in <hi>Flaminia,</hi> partly by favor, and partly by storm.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. Upon the News of this, <hi>Pompey,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>C. Marcellus</hi> and <hi>L.

The <hi>Senat</hi> being a little slack on the matter, he went to <hi>Massilia,</hi> where the Gates were shut upon him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he fitted out a Fleet and besieg'd it by Sea and Land; and having left Deputy Generals to manage the Siege, march'd himself into <hi>Spain</hi> where <hi>Petreius Afranius</hi> and <hi>Varro
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:136207:246"/> Pompey</hi>'s Generals surrender'd themselves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the whole Army.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. Then he return'd to <hi>Massilia,</hi> which was then reduc'd to a desperat Condition, and surrender'd it self. In his absence; <hi>M. Lepidus</hi> the <hi>Praetor</hi> made him Dict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, whereupon he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> call'd a Convention, and was made Consul along with <hi>P. Servilius Isauricus.</hi> Then, having settled his Affairs in the City, he cross'd over to <hi>Greece,</hi> and at last gave <hi>Pompey</hi> a signal overthrow in the <hi>Pharsalian</hi> Plains in <hi>Thessaly,</hi> and turn'd him out of his Camp, notwithstanding that <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Forces did much out-number his. <hi>Pompey</hi> fled to <hi>Egypt,</hi> to <hi>Ptolomaeus Dionysius</hi> the Son of <hi>Auletes,</hi> the Guardianship of whom had been allotted to him by the <hi>Senat.</hi> He hop'd to find assistance in that Kingdom, upon the score of his guardianship; but the King being under age, his Relations were influenc'd by <hi>Theodotus,</hi> his <hi>Preceptor,</hi> to receive him into a Boat and kill him, either because they dreaded some Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion might ensue upon assisting, him, or else because they contemn'd his mean Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. <hi>Caesar</hi> pursuing <hi>Pompey,</hi> came to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi> with 3200 Men; where he receiv'd the first News of <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Death. <hi>Ptolomy</hi> was at that time engag'd in a War with <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> his Sister. <hi>Caesar</hi> being at <hi>Alexandria</hi> fell in Love with <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> and advis'd her and her Brother not to dispute by force of Arms, but to remit their Differences to his determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, upon the consideration that he was made
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:136207:246"/> Consul for 5 Years, Dictator for one whole Year, and Tribune for Life, and that in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times an alliance had been contracted with <hi>Auletes</hi> the King's Father, with the Authority of a Law and a Decree of the <hi>Senate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="13">13. But the Kings Favorites dislik'd the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion mightily. They cry'd out, that it was unworthy of the King's Majesty to plead his cause at another Tribunal. Insomuch that War was declar'd against <hi>Caesar</hi> under the Name of the <hi>Alexandrian-War:</hi> but <hi>Caesar</hi> after several Encounters obtain'd the Victory, and did not indeed turn <hi>Egypt</hi> into a Province, but gave it to <hi>Cleopatra</hi> (who bore <hi>Caesario</hi> to him) in conjunction with her Younger Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for the King was drown'd in the River upon his flight.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. From thence he march'd into <hi>Syria,</hi> and after that to <hi>Pontus,</hi> where he routed <hi>Pharn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aces</hi> the Son of <hi>Mithridates,</hi> and pacify'd <hi>Cappa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docia, Armenia, Gallograecia, Pontus,</hi> and <hi>Bithynia.</hi> Then he return'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> and at the next Winter solstice cross'd over from <hi>Lilybaeum</hi> to <hi>Africa;</hi> notwithstanding that the Head Sooth-sayer had advis'd him not to go before the middle of Winter. After the <hi>Pharsalian</hi> battle, <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Cato,</hi> Great-Grand-Son to <hi>M. Porcius Cato,</hi> had fled thither, and drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a considerable body of Horse, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd <hi>Juba</hi> the King in their Quarrel; Upon which account <hi>Caesar,</hi> went upon this Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and cut them all off.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. But <hi>Cato</hi> laid violent Hands upon himself, in order to avoid his being taken Prisoner. <hi>Cicero</hi> defends the Action, and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:136207:247"/> in regard that Nature had given him an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible measure of gravity, says, 'twas better for him to do so than look a Tyrant in the face. Cato was a stoick, and sometimes defended very akward Opinions in the <hi>Senate,</hi> as if, says <hi>Cicero,</hi> he had been bred up not upon the dregs of <hi>Romulus</hi> but upon <hi>Plato</hi>'s Politicks. Afterwards <hi>Caesar</hi> came to <hi>Rome,</hi> and had a triumphal Procession upon his Conquests of <hi>France, Egypt, Pontus,</hi> and <hi>Africa.</hi> Then he engag'd in the War against <hi>S.

                     <p n="16">16. But before he went into <hi>Spain,</hi> he took care to have the model of the Year corrected, which from him was call'd <hi>Julian.</hi> When he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd from <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> he dimitted his Consulship a third time, and appointed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls elect for 3 Months. The first were <hi>Q. Fabius Maximus</hi> and <hi>C.

Then the <hi>Senators</hi> indeed appointed <hi>Caesar</hi> to be perpetual <hi>Dictator,</hi> and <hi>Emperor</hi> indeed, in so far as that word implies the greatest power in the Common-wealth. For the military Affairs and the raising of Mony depended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely upon him; and all the Magistrats were at his beck, and oblig'd by Oath not to oppose his Decrees.</p>

He was born when <hi>Cicero</hi> was Consul, and lost his Father when he was 4 Years of Age. He study'd Philosophy at <hi>Apollonia,</hi> and was about to be call'd home by <hi>Caesar</hi> in order to go upon the <hi>Parthian</hi> War, when he got notice of his Death, and the Heritage that was left him. When he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> he expected that <hi>Anthony</hi> wou'd assist him in resenting the Murther of his Father; but when he went to wait of him, met with a disdainful reception; and when he found that he wou'd not advance him the Mony to be giv'n to the People ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Will, sold his own Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and by so doing did mightily ingratiate himself with the People.</p>

                     <p n="6">6. At last, the two Armies engag'd at <hi>Philippi,</hi> a Town of <hi>Macedonia.

                     <p n="7">7. But <hi>Antony,</hi> who was reduc'd to great Want, was under a necessity of fighting, and challeng'd him to Battle. <hi>Brutus</hi> cou'd not in Honour decline Battle, so that they came to an Engagement, in which they were so eager, that they laid aside their Darts, and disputed the point with their Swords. <hi>Brutus</hi> seeing his Army routed and put to flight, kill'd himself, and with him fell the popular form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which seem'd to have yet a Being while and he <hi>Cassius</hi> did not despair of the Victory, as being possess'd of the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Empire from <hi>Macedonia</hi> to the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> with 20 Legions of Foot, 20000 Horse, 200 long Ships, and an infinite Sum of Money.</p>

                     <p n="9">9.

                     <p n="10">10. <hi>Sextus Pompeius</hi> infested the Sea, and did so straiten the Town for Provisions, that the People were in a great ferment, and the <hi>Triumviri</hi> were oblig'd to make Peace with him, in the same Year that <hi>Herod</hi> was declar'd King of Jewry.

               <p n="1">1. THe <hi>Roman</hi> Empire had now swallow'd up the <hi>Macedonian,</hi> together with all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, <hi>Republicks</hi> and Principalities, Contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary to it, excepting the <hi>Parthian</hi> Kingdom, which had not yet subjected it self; but when its domestick Divisions brought it under, they, did not long continue in obedience. <hi>Rome</hi> was now oppress'd with it's own weight, and being of a full rank complexion, stood ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to danger; every one made a noise of Liberty, but no body injoy'd it. Every man endeavor'd to procure a Principality to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, according as his Wit, Power, or Riches cou'd carry him out. In their Councils and Conventions, every thing was expos'd to Sale; their Magistracies were obtain'd either by Money or open Force. Now there was
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:136207:252"/> no way of remedying those Evils, but only a Monarchy, which could curb the boundless Power of the Mob, and the aspiring temper of seditious Men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Caesar Octavianus</hi> had weighed all these things with himself; and was very anxious for his own Safety and Honour. When he return'd to <hi>Rome</hi> he consulted <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Maecenas</hi> upon the form of the Government. <hi>Agrippa</hi> alledg'd that the full Authority ought to be put into the hands of the People; that whoever invaded the Popular Power had been punish'd for their Ambition, and that it was a very considerable Argument, that the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> under a popular form of Government, had done such mighty things. But <hi>Maecenas</hi> plainly made it out that the shapeless form of Democracy had lately deriv'd disgrace upon the <hi>Republick;</hi> that all their domestick Losses and civil Wars, were only owing to the overgrown Power of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which Ambitious and Turbulent Men had made use of for their own ends; and by that means all were debauch'd by Faction, Partiality and Bribes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And after all, this was the true state of the matter, with reference both to the <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans:</hi> For after the <hi>Grecians</hi> disclaim'd Monarchy, they never knew where to fix. The Harangues of Factious Men toss'd 'em to and again, as the Winds do the Sea; and the Constitutions of all their Cities were such, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> approv'd of none of 'em. For now and then Innovations still prevail'd, and Barbarous Murders were committed, while
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:136207:252"/> one Party stood for <hi>Oligarchy,</hi> and the other for <hi>Democracy.</hi> Besides, while they butcher'd one another in Civil Wars, they never did any thing of moment abroad, till at last <hi>Aelxan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>'s Yoke united them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In like manner the <hi>Romans</hi> had no sooner ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd their King but Sedition prevail'd among them, and grew to that height, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty separated thrice from the Nobility; and in the space of 134 Years there happen'd 37 Innovations, and for 5 Years together there were no Magistrats. All their great Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were accomplish'd by Generals that were intrusted wholly with the charge of the War, and a full Authority; who were not thwarted by <hi>Colleagues</hi> of different Sentiments, but us'd rather to give then receive Laws. In the beginning, the Government was still in the hands of Kings, till Ambition and Seditious Heats invented other ways of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. So that Monarchy seems justly to be deriv'd from the Power of Governors, and that from the paternal Authority.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Octavius</hi> was not very eager in taking the Government into his hand; but <hi>Maecenas</hi> push'd him on; proving by the Instances of <hi>Pompey, Marius, Sylla,</hi> and others, that if he quitted the Government, his Person was not safe. He added many Arguments, which contain'd a lively description of the ensuing Administration. <hi>Caesar</hi> subscrib'd to his Opinion, and invested himself with the Title of <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,</hi> which signifies the suprem Power, and in that sence was giv'n to his Father and all his Posterity. He was made <hi>Censor</hi> along with
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:136207:253"/>
                  <hi>Agrippa;</hi> and in his 6th Consulship made a review of the People, in which the number of the Citizens was reckon'd 4063000. He endeavour'd, by all means to ingratiate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with the People, and in regard that several unjust and harsh things had been enacted in the Civil Wars, especially in the time of the Triumvirate, repeal'd them all in one Edict.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Being made Consul a 7th time, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted all the <hi>Senators</hi> of his Party, with his Design, and came into the <hi>Senate-House,</hi> where he recited a Harangue from his Papers, and pretended to lay aside all manner of Authority: Whereupon all the <hi>Senators</hi> press'd him to continue it, and at last, with great difficulty, he seem'd to comply with their earnest Demands. By this artifice he establish'd himself in the Government, and then distributed most of the Provinces, reserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the strongest and best fortified to himself. 'Twas mov'd in the <hi>Senate,</hi> that a more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Title than that of <hi>Caesar,</hi> should be thought of for him; and <hi>Manacius Plancus</hi> pitch'd upon <hi>Augustus,</hi> which all of 'em ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd of. Then they made a Law, which the Laywers call <hi>Lex Regia,</hi> transferring the whole Authority of the <hi>Senate</hi> and People to him. The Provinces were distributed on the 23th day of <hi>January;</hi> and upon the fourth day after that, was he Sirnam'd <hi>Caesar Augustus:</hi> But the <hi>Romans</hi> date the <hi>Epocha</hi> of the <hi>August<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>'s from the 1st day of that <hi>January,</hi> in the 7th Consulship of <hi>Octavianus Caesar,</hi> the 727th Year after the building of the City, the 2d of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:136207:253"/> the 188th <hi>Olympiad,</hi> the 13th of <hi>Herod</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> the 25th before the Birth of Christ, <hi>A. M.</hi> 3978. <hi>Octavius Caesar</hi> and <hi>M. Vip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanius Agrippa</hi> being then Consuls.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Augustus</hi> being thus entrusted with the Government by the consent of the People, apply'd himself much to the modelling of the State, and made several new Laws. He often imparted his designs to others, and in some things follow'd their Advice. But he chiefly consulted the Consuls; or his Colleague, when he was Consul himself. He pitch'd upon one Man from each Magistracy, and by Lot drew 15 of the <hi>Senators,</hi> to assist him for 6 Months in the administration of Affairs. Some things indeed, he laid before the <hi>Senate:</hi> but he chose to communicate the Difficulties and Mysteries of State, only to a few. Some Causes were remitted to the Senate, who gave their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponse by Legates, but the greater number was left to his Privy Council. Sometimes he call'd a <hi>Common Council,</hi> but his Will was there a Law. He nominated some Magestrates himself, and left the nomination of others to the People; but only took care that none crept into Offices by Fraud and Circumven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Next Year <hi>Augustus</hi> pacify'd <hi>Spain,</hi> and shut the Temple of <hi>Janus</hi> the second time; but the commotions of <hi>Egypt</hi> quickly open'd it again. After that, he march'd into <hi>Greece,</hi> and then into <hi>Syria,</hi> and recover'd the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards from the <hi>Parthians</hi> which <hi>Crassus</hi> and <hi>Antony</hi> had lost, and likewise obtain'd the delivery of the Legates from <hi>Pandion</hi> and

                  <hi>Porus</hi> King of the <hi>Indians.</hi> While <hi>Augustus</hi> stay'd at <hi>Athens,</hi> he met with <hi>Virgil</hi> the Poet, who had retir'd to <hi>Greece,</hi> to perfect his <hi>Aeneids. Augustus</hi> brought him back with him; but in taking a view of <hi>Megara,</hi> in a very hot Season, he was seiz'd with an Illness, which the navigation inflam'd, so that he dy'd at <hi>Brundusium,</hi> on the 22d day of <hi>September</hi> in 52d Year of his age, the 735th after the building of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Consulship of <hi>C. Sentius</hi> and <hi>Q. Lucretius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Augustus</hi> had a Daughter nam'd <hi>Julia,</hi> by <hi>Scribonia</hi> his Wife. He divorc'd <hi>Scribonia,</hi> and too kin <hi>livia Drusilla,</hi> Wife to <hi>Claudius Nero</hi> in her Room, tho at the same time she was big-belly'd; for within three Months after the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, he brought forth <hi>Drusus,</hi> having formerly born <hi>Tiberius</hi> to <hi>Nero. Augustus</hi> had no Issue by <hi>Livia</hi> that liv'd any considerable time. He gave his Daughter <hi>Julia</hi> in marriage to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi> Son to <hi>Octavia</hi> his Sister; and after his Death, to <hi>Agrippa,</hi> to whom she bore three Sons, namely <hi>Caius, Lucius,</hi> and <hi>Agrippa Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humus,</hi> besides <hi>Agrippina</hi> and <hi>Julia</hi> two Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. <hi>Agrippa</hi> had a part of the Authority of a <hi>Tribune,</hi> and govern'd <hi>Syria</hi> ten Years; and after he had pacify'd <hi>Pannonia,</hi> return'd to <hi>Campania,</hi> where he died. Then <hi>Tiberius</hi> was order'd to marry <hi>Julia,</hi> and to divorce his Wife <hi>Agrippina</hi> Daughter to <hi>Agrippa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>Tiberius</hi> and <hi>Drusus</hi> (two brethren) subdued the <hi>Rhaeti</hi> and <hi>Vindelici</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> as also the <hi>Pannonians</hi> and <hi>Frisians.</hi> But <hi>Drusus</hi> having penetrated a great way into <hi>Germany,</hi> and just enter'd upon his Consulship

Soon after, <hi>Tiberius</hi> conquer'd the <hi>Germans</hi> by Stratagem, and retir'd to <hi>Rhodes,</hi> upon the account of his Wife <hi>Julia</hi>'s wantonness, which was then arriv'd at such a pitch of Impudence, that her Father banish'd her to the Isle <hi>Pandataria;</hi> for he was so much out of humour upon her Debauchery, that he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudently expos'd it to the <hi>Senat.</hi> Indeed he was afterwards conscious of his Error in so doing, and us'd to say, that, had <hi>Maecenas</hi> or <hi>Agrippa</hi> been alive, he had ne're been guilty of such an oversight.

However, the Evangelist teaches us, that Christ was about 30 Years of age in the 15th Year of <hi>Tiberius.</hi> So that

                  <hi>Caesar Augustus</hi> liv'd 15 Years after the birth of Christ; and if we date the Commencement of his Empire from the Death of <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> he reigned in all 57 Years, and our Lord was born in the 42 of his Reign; but if we date it from the Death of <hi>Antony</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> the Birth of our Lord must be cast into the 28th of his Reign, that is, the 4003 Year of the World, the 752 of <hi>Rome,</hi> the 3d of the 194 <hi>Olympiad,</hi> in the Consulship of <hi>Caesar Augustus</hi> (for the 13th time) and <hi>M.

               <p n="12">12. <hi>Herod</hi> who had then reign'd about 37 Years, design'd to make away with Christ, by giving orders to kill all the Children in the Neighbourhood, under two Years of age; but miss'd his Aim. Now to carry down the thread of the Jewish History after this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; <hi>Herod</hi> had possess'd himself of the Kingdom, and took care to have <hi>Aristobulus</hi> slain as he was a swimming. This <hi>Aristobulus</hi> was brother to <hi>Mariamne</hi> his Wife, and Heir to the Kingdom of <hi>Jewry,</hi> whom <hi>Herod</hi> had turn'd out of the Priesthood. Tho' <hi>Herod</hi> sided with <hi>Antony,</hi> yet after his defeat and Death, he gain'd <hi>Caesar</hi>'s favor by his magnificence. Soon after he murder'd <hi>Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amne</hi> his beloved Wife; and repented of the Action too late; upon which occasion he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Mad, and acted unspeakable cruelty.</p>
               <p n="18">18. In the 7th or 8th Year before the birth of <hi>Christ,</hi> he repair'd the Temple of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> very magnificently. He likewise raz'd <hi>Davids</hi> Tomb, after which time his

He put his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren <hi>Aristobulus</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> to death, upon their being arraign'd of a Conspiracy, by those who mean'd to rise upon their ruine. After their Death, <hi>Antipater</hi> the Son of another Wife, and <hi>Pheroras</hi> the King's Brother, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spir'd against him. Not long after the King was seiz'd with a horrid Distemper of which he died, after he had given orders for the Death of <hi>Antipater,</hi> and attempted to lay violent hands on himself. He died in the 72d Year of his age, the 27th of his Reign, about 2 Years after the birth of Christ, in the 1st Year of the 195 <hi>Olympiad,</hi> the 754th after the building of the City, <hi>Caius Caesar</hi> and <hi>L.

               <p n="14">14 He left his Kingdom to his Son <hi>Archelaus.</hi> But <hi>Augustus</hi> gave him only the half of it, and adjudg'd the other half to <hi>Antipas</hi> and <hi>Philip,</hi> his brethren.

                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:136207:256"/> but <hi>Augustus</hi> discover'd the Cheat. After ten Years <hi>Archelaus</hi> was banish'd to <hi>Vienna</hi> in <hi>Gaul,</hi> upon the account of his Tyranny; and his whole Estate was confis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated: Then <hi>Cyrenius</hi> being sent into <hi>Syria</hi> possess'd himself of the same; and from thence one <hi>Judas</hi> a <hi>Gaulonite,</hi> and <hi>Sodoe</hi> a <hi>Pharisees,</hi> took occasion to rebell. At this juncture the Princes of <hi>Judaea</hi> fail'd, and it began to be govern'd by <hi>Procuratores;</hi> the first of whom was <hi>Coponius,</hi> to whom succeeded <hi>M.

               </p>
               <p n="15">15. <hi>Augustus</hi> adopted <hi>Caius</hi> and <hi>Lucius</hi> his Grand-Sons, and gave 'em the Title of <hi>Princes of the Youth.</hi> But <hi>Lucius</hi> being sent into <hi>Spain</hi> died there; and about 18 Months after, the like fate happen'd to <hi>Caius</hi> upon his return from <hi>Armenia</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi> Then <hi>Tiberius</hi> and <hi>Agrippa Posthumus</hi> were adopted in their room. The former of whom was order'd to adopt <hi>Germanicus</hi> the Son of <hi>Drusus,</hi> in order to prevent his ambitious Attempts. <hi>Tiberius</hi> conquer'd the <hi>Germans,</hi> and reduc'd the <hi>Panonians</hi> and <hi>Dalmatians;</hi> but was denied a Triumph, by reason that the Legions were almost all cut off in <hi>Germany</hi> by <hi>Arominius</hi> General of the <hi>Cherusci,</hi> under the conduct of <hi>Quintilius Varus,</hi> which <hi>Augustus</hi> took so much to heart that among other marks of his Grief, he us'd to dash his head against the Gate, and Cry out, <hi>Redde Legiones Quintili Vare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. <hi>Tiberius</hi> was then sent to put things to rights in <hi>Germany,</hi> and after 3 Years, <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus Caesar</hi> succeeded him. <hi>Tiberius</hi> Triumph'd thrice, and was invested with a power over
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:136207:256"/> the Provinces and Armies, equal to that of <hi>Augustus;</hi> and after he had exercis'd that Power three Years, obtain'd the Monarchy it self, upon the Death of <hi>Augustus,</hi> which happen'd on the 19th Day of the Month of <hi>August,</hi> (the same Day that gave date to his first Consulship) in the 76th Year of his age, the 767th of the City, the 2d of the 198th <hi>Olympiad,</hi> the 57th after the Death of <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> the 15 after the Birth of <hi>Christ,</hi> when <hi>Sextus Pompeius</hi> and <hi>Sextus Apuleius</hi> were Consuls.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Notwithstanding that <hi>Tiberius</hi> had sufficiently fortify'd this Government, by the intrest of his Mother <hi>Livia,</hi> who by some was charg'd with Poysoning her Husband; yet he seem'd to be very unwilling to take the Government upon him, and 'twas after the repeated intreaties of the <hi>Senate,</hi> that he at length comply'd. At first, he made a shew of Modesty and Singular Temperance; and did nothing upon his own bottom, but had recourse to the <hi>Senate,</hi> upon things of any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. He envy'd <hi>Germanicus</hi> mightily; who had purchas'd much Glory by his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements; and banish'd him under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of sending him to compose some Tumults in the East; and afterwards made away with him by the Ministry of <hi>Piso. Germanicus</hi> was an excellent Man, and the Darling, not only of the <hi>Romans,</hi> but of the <hi>Barbarians</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. He had three Sons by <hi>Agrippina</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Julia,</hi> namely, <hi>Nero, Drusus</hi> and <hi>Caius,</hi> with as many Daughters. He died in the 34th Year of his age, the

               <p n="18">18. After a few Years, <hi>Tiberius</hi> was punish'd for this his Patricide, in the Death of his Son <hi>Drusus,</hi> of which <hi>Sejanus</hi> was the Author. Now he had rais'd this Son of his to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreet pitch of greatness, and Loaded him with unripe and unseasonable Dignities. At last he laid aside his Mask, and took up his undisguis'd temper; and without minding the Government of the <hi>Repulick,</hi> gave himself wholly to cruel and voluptuous measures; and in a word, behav'd himself so, that, 'twas ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent <hi>Theodorus Gadareus</hi> his Preceptor, had not spoke amiss, when he said that his Pupill was <gap reason="foreign">

In the 12th Year of <hi>Tiberius, Pontius Pilat</hi> succeeded <hi>Valerius Gratus</hi> the fourth Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of <hi>Judaea;</hi> who by exposing the Image of <hi>Caesar</hi> in the Publick places, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion'd so much Sedition in <hi>Judaea,</hi> that he could not appease it, till he sent away the Images to <hi>Caesarea.</hi> In the beginning of the 15th Year of <hi>Tiberius</hi>'s Reign, <hi>Pontius Pilat</hi> being then Governor, did <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> begin to preach in the Spirit of <hi>Elias,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides many other deeds, baptis'd <hi>our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> who being full of the Holy Ghost, enter'd immedieatly upon the office of <hi>our Saviour.</hi> Having seen three Passovers in the course of his Ministry, he was sacrific'd at the fourth, and so became <hi>our true Passover.</hi>

Upon the death of Christ, the Sun was darken'd, either by the interposition of the Moon, (tho' indeed the Passover was always solemniz'd at Full Moon) or else by the Imprisonment of its own Light. This Eclipse is mention'd in the Heathen Kalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars, and among other Historians by <hi>Phlegon Trallianus, Adrianus</hi>'s servant made Free. <hi>Jose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi> that noble <hi>Jewish</hi> Historian, gives a Memorable Testimony of Christ; and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Heathen Authors write of him. Upon his coming into the World, the Oracles were silenc'd; and in regard that, according to <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch,</hi> the great <hi>Pan</hi> was said to dye in the time of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> by him we are to understand Christ, our great Shepherd.

               <p n="2">2. Some alledge that <hi>Tiberius</hi> cunningly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated <hi>Caius</hi> as Successor, to the end that his own wickedness might be drown'd in the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous Crimes of his Successor. The Army
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:136207:258"/> were very ready to receive their new Prince, as being come of a Family, which they Pitied upon the account of the injuries and affronts put upon it by <hi>Tiberius;</hi> for indeed <hi>Caius</hi> had only avoided the Effects of <hi>Tiberius</hi>'s Cruelty by dissembling his anger, and tamely sitting with affronts; so that 'twas a very true saying, that was bandy'd about, <hi>viz. That there never was a better Servant, nor a worse Master than Caligula.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Caius</hi> made <hi>Agrippa</hi> Son to <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> and Grandson to <hi>Herod</hi> the Great, King of that Country which <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Tetrarch</hi> pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd. He banish'd <hi>Antipas</hi> together with his Wife <hi>Herodias,</hi> to <hi>Lions; and Pontius Pilat</hi> to <hi>Vienna,</hi> where he laid violent hands on himself after two Years exile. At first <hi>Caius</hi> behav'd himself meekly; but afterwards he became a downright Monster. In the very first Year, he spent all that infinite Sum of Gold, that <hi>Tiberius</hi> had gather'd in the 23 Years that he reign'd: He arrogated to himself divine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and display'd incredible cuelrty.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

However the <hi>Praetorian Soldiers</hi> had a mighty itch to dispose of the Empire, and accordingly gave it to <hi>Tiberius Claudius Drusus,</hi> Brother to <hi>Germanicus Caesar,</hi> and Son to <hi>Drusus,</hi> who had despair'd so much of his Life, that he kept himself <hi>incognito.</hi>

But at length his Mother endeavor'd to engross the Empire to herself, whereupon he embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued in a Quarrel with her; and laid aside his Mask. He Poyson'd his Brother <hi>Britannicus,</hi> as being a Rival. He fell in Love with <hi>Poppaea

This <hi>Ananus Junior,</hi> put to Death <hi>James</hi> the <hi>Just,</hi> the Brother of our Lord; and by so doing disoblig'd all good Men, as <hi>Josephus</hi> testifies; and in consideration that the Priests had no Power of Life and Death, <hi>Agrippa</hi> turn'd him out of his Office.</p>
               <p n="10">10.

While the Prince went on in this fashon like a Monstrous Beast, a Conspiracy was carried on against him by <hi>Cn.

               <head type="sub">From the Death of <hi>Nero,</hi> to the Death of <hi>Domitian,</hi> the last of the <hi>Vespasian</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. The Space of <hi>27</hi> Years.</head>
               <p n="1">1. AFter the Death of <hi>Claudius,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was reduc'd to such wretched Circumstances, that 'twas in the Army's Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to nominate the Emperor. From whence by an odd Catastrophe the credit and Glory of the imperial Station was Transfer'd from the Ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Families to Strangers; and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of a Scandalous rank were perfer'd to that dignity. Some of 'em were <hi>Spaniards,</hi> some deriv'd their Original from <hi>Pannonia, Dacia, Dardania, Dalmatia, Gallia, Thracia,</hi> and some from <hi>Cappadocia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:136207:262"/>2. Besides, the Emperors themselves were in a doubtfull condition, for their dignity and safety depended upon the Legions and the Army, and not upon the <hi>Senate</hi> and People. Insomuch that it may be reckon'd a Wonder, that any were found to engage in so Hazardous and uncertain a post. For between the Death of <hi>Caius Caesar</hi> who was Murder'd in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the <hi>Senate,</hi> and the reign of <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maigne,</hi> there were about 30 Emperors kill'd, and 4 more laid violent Hands on themselves. The Soldiers had always something to charge upon them; they were equally uneasy under the good and the bad; and upon the least oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion gather'd into a Body and cut the Throats of those whom they themselves had forc'd to accept the Diadem against their Wills. Indeed the <hi>Senate</hi> dreaded the Emperor, but the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror himself was altogether at the beck of a heedless Army.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This masterly Humor did chiefly prevail after the Death of <hi>Caesar,</hi> in those Veteran Legions which he made use of in <hi>Gaul, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Africa:</hi> And <hi>Cicero</hi> regreating the case, says, <hi>'Tis true, these Legions are brave; but the sense of the services they've done in ensuring the Liberty of the People of</hi> Rome, <hi>and enlarging the Honor of the State, has made 'em too presuming, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spir'd 'em with a humor of Levelling all our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels to their force.</hi> But <hi>Galba,</hi> who by this method was prefer'd to be Emperor, did not make good the hopes that were conceiv'd of him, when in a private Station. Indeed had he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reign'd, he had been reckon'd worthy of an Empire: for he seem'd rather to be Free from
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:136207:262"/> Vice, than to be entitled to Vertue. His severity procur'd him the Odium of the Army; so that <hi>Otho</hi> took care to have him slain on the 14th day of <hi>January,</hi> in the 73 Year of his Age, after he had reign'd 7 Months.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Galba</hi> being kill'd, <hi>M. Salvius Otho</hi> was declar'd Emperor by his Soldiers; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that <hi>Vitellius</hi> was at the same time chosen Emperor by his Army, laid violent hands on himself, in order to prevent the Dammage that might accrue to the State from their mutual Contention. <hi>Vitellius</hi> usurp'd the Empire, and minded nothing but gratifying his Appetite; he cry'd up <hi>Nero</hi> in all his Actions, and imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him as his Pattern. He was so drown'd in his Pleasures, that he would neither speak, nor hear any Person speak of War; Nay, he prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the spreading about of any Reports to that purpose; till at last he was frighted out of that humor by the arrival of <hi>Vespasian,</hi> who upon the desire of the Legions in <hi>Judaea,</hi> had made himself Emperor. This <hi>Vespasian,</hi> had maul'd the <hi>Jews</hi> in several Encounters, who were miserably divided into many Factions; Nay, he had subdu'd the whole Country, excepting three Castles and <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> After that, the Armies of several Provinces invited him to take upon him the Government of the Empire, and at last he comply'd with their Requests, and march'd towards <hi>Italy.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellius</hi> was affronted, kill'd, and Thrown into the <hi>Tiber,</hi> in the 57th Year of his Age, after he had reign'd 8 Months and 5 Days.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In the mean time some Commotions hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Gaul,</hi> which at length were
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:136207:263"/> compos'd by the conduct of <hi>Petilius Cerealis.</hi> The <hi>Sarmatians</hi> also had cross'd the <hi>Ister,</hi> and put the <hi>Roman</hi> Provinces to fire and Sword; but <hi>Rubrius Gallus</hi> beat 'em off, and kill'd many of 'em. <hi>Titus,</hi> the Son of <hi>Vaspasian,</hi> being left by his Father in <hi>Judaea,</hi> continued to carry on the War, and after a long Siege took <hi>Jerusalem. Josephus,</hi> who was an Eye-witness, gives us strange Accounts of the Divisions of that miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able People; and the Calamity and Extream want they were in. The City and Temple were set in a Flame, on the 8th of <hi>September,</hi> in the 2d Year of <hi>Vespasian,</hi> he and his Son <hi>Titus</hi> being then Consuls; 38 Years after the Death of Christ, whose blood lay heavily upon them. Now <hi>Jerusalem</hi> was taken six times. <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Asochaeus</hi> the <hi>Egyptian, Nebuchadnezar, Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus Epiphanes, Pompey, Herod</hi> and <hi>Sosius,</hi> and at last by <hi>Titus:</hi> and it was twice raz'd, namely, once by <hi>Nebuchadnezar,</hi> and at last by <hi>Titus.</hi> Between this 'its last overthrow, and <hi>David</hi>'s first taking the City from the <hi>Jebusites,</hi> there interven'd 1179 Years, but the City was of 2177 Years standing.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The number of the Jewish Prisoners a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to 97000, and 1100000 besides died in the time of the Siege. <hi>Vespasian</hi> sold the Ground, and laid upon the People a Yearly Tribute to be pay'd to the Capitol instead of the Temple. At length the War was put to an end by <hi>P. Sylva,</hi> who took the Castle of <hi>Messada;</hi> and when the <hi>Jews in Egypt and Cyrene</hi> rebell'd, their Temple, which <hi>Onias</hi> had built, was shut up, and the Rebels were presently crush'd, <hi>Jonathan</hi> their General being taken, who
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:136207:263"/> among others laid a false Accusation against <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus</hi> the Historian, and thereupon was whip'd and burnt alive. <hi>Josephus</hi> has carried down the thread of their Wars to this time, and had a Statue erected for him, his Books being thought worthy to be kept in the publick Library at <hi>Rome.</hi> At last he finish'd his Volumes of <hi>Jewish</hi> Antiquities is the 15th Year of <hi>Dominian,</hi> and the 56th of his Age, according to his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in the close of that work.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The <hi>Lex Regia</hi> was renew'd on the behalf of <hi>Vespasian,</hi> by which the Power of the People was transfer'd to <hi>Augustus,</hi> and his Successors. He made <hi>Achaia, Lycia, Rhodes, Byzantium, Samos, Cilicia</hi> and <hi>Comagene,</hi> Provinces of the People of <hi>Rome.</hi> He was entitled to Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Clemency, but reckon'd a little greedy; he was a great Promoter of Liberal Sciences, and was the first that ordered Plublick <hi>Sallaries</hi> the Teachers. He died of a bloody-flux in the 69 Year of his Age, the 10th of his Reign, the 832 after the building of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the 79th of Christ, <hi>Titus</hi> being then Consul, together with his Father, who had been Consul six times before.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>Titus</hi> succeeded his Father on the 23th of <hi>May,</hi> having been educated along with <hi>Britan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus.</hi> In his privat capacity he was suspected of Ambition, Luxury, and other Vices; and in a word was look'd upon as another <hi>Nero.</hi> But when he became Emperor he dispell'd all their Jealousies by the agreeableness of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, and by a Lucky Turn became the Darling of Human kind. He died to the infinite loss and Grief of the whole Empire, after he had reign'd two Years and 20 days, in the 42d
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:136207:264"/> Year of his Age, the 834th after the building of the City, and the 81st of our Lord, <hi>M. Plautius Sylvanus</hi> and <hi>M. Annius Verus</hi> being then Consuls.</p>
               <p n="9">9. After <hi>Titus, Domitian</hi> his Brother succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who was deem'd for killing him, tho' he had formerly obtain'd a Pardon for designing the same Crime. He resembled rather <hi>Nero, Caligula,</hi> or <hi>Tiberius,</hi> than his Father and Brother. At first his cruelty was only display'd upon the Fliees which he us'd to run through with a Bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin, but afterwards he laid aside his modesty and became very cruel; and <hi>Antony</hi> being fretted by his Affronts and Vices, rebel'd in <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Germany. Domitian</hi> fought successfullly with the <hi>Chattians, Dacians,</hi> and <hi>Sarmatians,</hi> and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph'd over them. At last being hated by all, he was kill'd by his own Servants, on the 17th of <hi>September,</hi> in the 55 Year of his Age; the 15th of his Reign, the 849th after the building of the City, and the 96 of our Lord, <hi>T. Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius Valens</hi> and <hi>C. Antistius Vetus</hi> being then Consuls. In his time, <hi>Statius Juvenal,</hi> and <hi>Martial,</hi> the Poets, flourish'd.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>Dionysius</hi> the <hi>Arcopagite</hi> was made first Bishop of <hi>Athens</hi> by the Apostle <hi>Paul.</hi> After <hi>Linus</hi> the Martyr, <hi>Cletus</hi> or <hi>Anacletus</hi> and <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi> succeeded in the See of <hi>Rome; Abilius</hi> succeeded <hi>Anianus</hi> first Bishop of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria;</hi> then <hi>Andrew</hi> the Apostle, <hi>Stachys, One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simus, Polycarpus</hi> and <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> who was chosen in the 2d Year of <hi>Domitian. Domitian</hi> was the Author of the 2d Persecution of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in which <hi>John</hi> the Apostle was banish'd to the Isle of <hi>Patmos,</hi> where he writ his Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:136207:264"/> and in that Book makes mention of the <hi>Nicolaites;</hi> for many heresies prevail'd in the Church at that time. <hi>Eusebius</hi> would have <hi>Simon Magus</hi> to be the first Head of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks.</hi> However not only the <hi>Nicolaites,</hi> but the <hi>Cerinthians, Menander, Basilides,</hi> and their Disciples, and <hi>Carpocrates</hi> with the <hi>Gnosticks,</hi> his Retainers; and the <hi>Ebionites,</hi> did then disturb the Church of God.</p>

               <p n="1">1. 'TIs said that <hi>Domitian</hi> Dream'd that a Golden Head and Neck grew out of his Shoulders; which was plainly verified by the Virtue and modesty of the succeeding Princes, tho' they were Forreigners. Next to <hi>Domitian</hi> was <hi>Cocceius Nerva</hi> who joyn'd the People's Liberty to his Government, which none had done before him. He adopted <hi>M. Ʋlpius Trajanus</hi> and scarce liv'd 3 Months after, for by a violent fit of Passion he was thrown into a Fever, of which he died on the 26th of <hi>January,</hi> after he had liv'd 65 Years, and reign'd one Year 4 Months and 9 Days; in the 851 Year, after the building of the City, and the 98 of our Lord; <hi>Trajan</hi> being then a 2d time, and he a 9th time Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sul.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Emperor <hi>Trajan</hi> reduc'd the <hi>Dacians</hi> twice. He went upon an Expedition into <hi>Armenia</hi> and <hi>Parthia;</hi> and the <hi>Parthians</hi> surrender'd themselves to him, from whence he was Sirnam'd <hi>Parthicus.</hi> He extended the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:136207:265"/> Limits of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire very far. But when he wag'd War with the Church of Christ, his Interest began to decline, and most of the People he had subdued, rebell'd against him, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in <hi>Armenia</hi> and <hi>Mesopotamia.</hi> The <hi>Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> also rejected the King he gave 'em. Upon his return to <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> rebell'd in several Places, and committed horrid Murders, and great <hi>Earthquakes</hi> happen'd. At last, he died in <hi>Cilicia</hi> of a <hi>Bloodyflux,</hi> after he had reign'd 19 Years, 6 Months, and 15 Days, in the 870 Year of the City, and the 117 of our Lord. In his Reign <hi>Plutarch, Lucian, Pliny</hi> the 2d, <hi>Suetonius, L. Florus</hi> and <hi>Cor. Tacitus</hi> flourish'd.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Trajan</hi> was follow'd by <hi>Aelius Adrianus</hi> Son to his Cusin German, who was perfer'd by the Interest of <hi>Plotina</hi> the Emperess. He conquer'd the <hi>Jews,</hi> who had rebell'd upon the account of a Temple built to <hi>Jupiter Olympius</hi> at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which he had allow'd to be inhabited. He visited <hi>Gaul, Germany, Brittain,</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> then <hi>Mauritania, Parthia, Asia</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> and return'd by <hi>Sicily</hi> to <hi>Rome.</hi> Then he went the 2d time to <hi>Africa</hi> and return'd to <hi>Rome;</hi> and after that went thro' <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Asia</hi> to <hi>Arabia</hi> and from thence to <hi>Egypt.</hi> In <hi>Adrian</hi>'s time the Church under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went some persecution, which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards taken away upon the Remonstrances of <hi>Quadratus</hi> and <hi>Aristides,</hi> by Letters sent from the Emperor to <hi>Minutius Fundanus</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consul of <hi>Asia,</hi> which are publish'd by <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> in his 2d Apology. This Emperor
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:136207:266"/> was extream curlous, and a great pursuer of Knowledge, but very illnatur'd to Men of better Learning. He died of a dropsie which threw him into a violent fit of Anger, on the 11th of <hi>July,</hi> after he had reign'd 2 Years and 11 Months, and liv'd 62 Years, in the 981st Year after the building of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the 138 of Christ, <hi>Sulpitius Camerinus</hi> and <hi>Quintius Magnus</hi> being then Consuls.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There flourish'd in his time <hi>Ptolomaeus</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> the Prince of Astronomers, <hi>A. Gellius</hi> or <hi>Agellius, Justinus</hi> the Epitomiser of <hi>Trogus,</hi> and several other Learned Men. The Lawyers in his time were <hi>Alburnius Valens, Tuscianus, Vindius Verus, Ʋlpius Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus, Arrianus, Tertullianus, Salvius Julianus, L. Volusius Metianus. Adrian</hi> did first adopt <hi>L. Verus</hi> who died in the Year preceding his Death, on the first of <hi>January,</hi> being the first Day of his 2d Consulship, <hi>L. Verus</hi> had a Son call'd <hi>Lucius,</hi> and was order'd to adopt <hi>Marcus;</hi> but these two being very Young, <hi>Adrian</hi> himself adopted <hi>Antoninus</hi> whom he order'd to adopt <hi>Lucius</hi> and <hi>Marcus.</hi> So he call'd a <hi>Senate,</hi> and recommended <hi>Antoninus</hi> to them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Antoninus</hi> was Sirnam'd <hi>Pius,</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to his regular conversation. He courted Peace, and endeavor'd to oblige eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one: and by the means of his humanity and letters kept the forreign Kings and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in order. He was an excellent Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:136207:266"/> insomuch that he was call'd <hi>Cymini Sector.</hi> He was kind to the Christians upon the remonstrances of <hi>Justin</hi> Martyr and some others; and Publish'd an Edict on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half. He died on the 7th of <hi>March,</hi> having reign'd 22 Years 7 Months and 26 Days, in the 1 Year of the 235 <hi>Olympiad,</hi> the 914th after the building of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the 161st of out Lord.

               <p n="6">6. <hi>Antoninus Pius</hi> was follow'd by <hi>Marcus</hi> the Son of <hi>Annius Verus,</hi> who was Sirnam'd the <hi>Philosopher,</hi> and took in <hi>L. Aurelius Verus</hi> his Cousin, to be Partner with him in the Empire. This was the first time that two with equal and joynt Authority Govern'd the <hi>Romans:</hi> But they were of very different tempers. <hi>Lucius</hi> carried on the <hi>Parthian</hi> War with success. <hi>Marcus</hi> manag'd things at home: But at last upon the Death of <hi>Verus,</hi> got the whole Empire to himself, and Fought successfully against the <hi>Germans.</hi> He likewise defeated the <hi>Marcomanni, Sarmatae, Vandali</hi> and <hi>Quadi,</hi> who invaded <hi>Pannonia.</hi> For at that time most of the Nations from <hi>Illyricum</hi> to <hi>Gaul</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spir'd against the <hi>Romans.</hi> The 4th Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Christians was rather owing to <hi>Verus</hi> than to <hi>Marcus.</hi> When the <hi>Roman</hi> Army was almost choak'd with Thirst in an expedition against the <hi>Quadi,</hi> the <hi>Legio

               <head type="sub">From the Death of <hi>Maximinus</hi> to the Monarchy of <hi>Constantine</hi> the first Christian Emperour, who translated the Seat of the Empire to <hi>Byzantium,</hi> or <hi>Constantinople,</hi> a City in <hi>Thrace.</hi> The space of <hi>86</hi> Years.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THE Senat and People of <hi>Rome</hi> were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd with the News of <hi>Maximinus</hi>'s Fate. And as for the new Emperors, every thing succeeded according to their Wishes, and wou'd have continued so to do, had not their mutual Jealousie and Feuds stood in the way. For the Lifeguard-men, who always hated those whom the <hi>Senat</hi> chose, finding that they were always quarrelling with one another, met with an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of executing their Designs upon them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They were kill'd after they had govern'd 2 Years, and then the Government was put into the Hands of <hi>Gordianus</hi> a Youth, who, in the 4th Year of his Empire, march'd thro' <hi>Maesia</hi> and <hi>Thrace</hi> against the <hi>Persians,</hi> and defeated the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of the <hi>Romans</hi> in those places. From thence he march'd thro' <hi>Syria</hi> to <hi>Antiochia,</hi> which was then in the <hi>Persian</hi> Hands. There he had frequent Battels, and conquer'd <hi>Sapor</hi> King of the <hi>Persians;</hi> so that the <hi>Persians,</hi> who were almost formidable to <hi>Italy,</hi> were thus confin'd within their own Territories. At last, in the 6th Year of his Empire, he was circumvented and killed by <hi>Philip</hi> the Pretorian Governour, who had rais'd a Mutiny among the Soldiers. But 'tis said that all his Assassins murdered themselves with
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:136207:271"/> the same Swords with which they attack'd him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Gordianus</hi> was follow'd by <hi>M. Julius Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippus</hi> an <hi>Arabian</hi> of <hi>Trachonitis,</hi> Son to a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Captain of the Robbers. But after 5 years he underwent the same Fate. For <hi>Quintus Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>janus Decius</hi> being sent to appease a Mutiny a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Soldiers, received the Purple Dignity from the Soldiers, and routed and kill'd <hi>Philip</hi> in a Battel at <hi>Verona,</hi> who was then carrying on a War by Legates with the <hi>Scyphi</hi> that infested the <hi>Roman</hi> Provinces. <hi>Decius</hi> being confirm'd in the Empire by the Consent of the Senators, first appeas'd the Commotions of <hi>Gaule,</hi> and then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving recommended the Care of the <hi>Republick</hi> to the <hi>Senate,</hi> went with their Consent, along with his Son, upon an Expedition against the <hi>Scythians,</hi> who infested <hi>Thrace,</hi> and several other Roman Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces both by Sea and Land. He had the better of 'em in several Battels; and, having forc'd up his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy into a narrow place, had certainly come off with the total Victory, had not <hi>Gallus-Hostilianus</hi> Governour of <hi>Maesia</hi> discover'd his Designs to the Enemy; by which means it came to pass, that the Father and Son were circumvented and kill'd. This Emperor was the Author of the 7th Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church of <hi>God;</hi> and reign'd 2 Years and a half.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Vibius Gallus Hostilianus</hi> being saluted Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror by one Legion, and the remains of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, made a Peace with the <hi>Scythians,</hi> promising to pay them a yearly Tribute; which was an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious and scandalous thing, and unsuitable to the Majesty of the <hi>Romans.</hi> By this means the <hi>Scythians</hi> became bolder, and violated the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:136207:272"/> Peace, in plundering <hi>Dardania, Thrace, Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> and pillaging and razing several Cities. Afterwards many follow'd the <hi>Scythian</hi> Example, some in declaring War, and some in rebelling against the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The <hi>Parthians</hi> having routed and put to flight <hi>Tiridates</hi> their own King, penetrated into <hi>Syria,</hi> and possess'd themselves of <hi>Armenia.</hi> The <hi>Scythians</hi> indeed became very insolent under Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess; but <hi>Aemilianus</hi> Governour of <hi>Maesia</hi> having animated his own Men with large Promises, and hopes of Reward, routed them upon the Borders of <hi>Sarmatia,</hi> and pursu'd them a great way into their own Countrey: Whereupon the Army declar'd him Emperor. Then <hi>Gallus</hi> march'd against him, but was kill'd, together with his Son <hi>Volusianus,</hi> his Partner in the Empire, after he had reign'd one Year.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In the mean time the other Army which was then in the <hi>Alps,</hi> bestow'd the Empire upon <hi>Valerian,</hi> a Man of a Noble Descent. Upon the news whereof, <hi>Aemilianus</hi>'s Soldiers, resolving to avoid trouble, slew their own Emperour, and stood for <hi>Valerian;</hi> who, after he was made Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, sent Letters to the Senate, engaging to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scue <hi>Thrace</hi> and <hi>Mesopotamia</hi> out of the Hands of the Enemies, to recover <hi>Armenia,</hi> and to beat off the Enemies of the <hi>Romans</hi> on all hands. But in the <hi>Persian</hi> War, thro' the Negligence of some of his Captains, he was taken Prisoner by <hi>Sapor,</hi> King of the <hi>Persians:</hi> For so it pleased <hi>God</hi> to resent the Death of his own People, against whom <hi>Valerian</hi> had carry'd on the 8th Persecution. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por</hi>'s Neighbouring Princes and Confederate Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions intreated him to deliver up the Royal Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:136207:272"/> remonstrating to him, that the <hi>Romans</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways made the most vigorous Resistance when they were worsted. But all these Remonstrances could not prevail with him; for, it's said, he made use of him as a Foot-stool when he mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Horse; and at last flea'd the Skin off him, and so left him to end his Days in Misery.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Valerian</hi> being taken Prisoner, his Son <hi>Gallienus</hi> succeeded, and put a stop to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, that his Father had begun against the <hi>Christians;</hi> but the <hi>Romans</hi> did not get off so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily from the Vengeance that follow'd the shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of so much innocent Blood. For <hi>Gallienus</hi> neglected the Affairs of the <hi>Republick,</hi> and gave himself wholly to his Pleasure; insomuch that the Soldiers chose new Emperors to themselves in the Provinces, to the number of 30 Tyrants; but they all came to nothing, partly by <hi>Gallienus</hi>'s Opposition, and partly by their own mutual Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences. At last, in the Reign of <hi>Gallienus,</hi> the <hi>Goths</hi> possess'd themselves of <hi>Thrace,</hi> laid <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia</hi> waste, and besieg'd <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> and the <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> invaded <hi>Bithynia Cappadocia</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> and advancing from the Euxine Sea to the <hi>Ister,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd the <hi>Roman</hi> Corporations.</p>
               <p n="8">8. But the Emperor was so lazy, that when he heard of the revolt of the Provinces and of the Publick Calamity, he always answer'd in a ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culing and contemptuous manner, as if the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick cou'd have subsisted and he maintain'd his Dignity, without any inconvenience upon that account. By this his contemptuous Carriage he gain'd many Enemies both at home and abroad. Besides, the <hi>Scythians</hi> and <hi>Goths,</hi> and a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Nations join'd with them, conspir'd

               <p n="9">9. For <hi>Gallienus</hi> was kill'd after he had reign'd 6 Years along with his Father and 9 by himself; and <hi>Claudius</hi> succeeded him, who was originally a <hi>Dalmatian,</hi> a Man of extraordinary Virtue, and one that merited a longer Life; for he was kill'd at <hi>Sirmium</hi> when he had scarce reign'd 2 Years. <hi>Quintilius</hi> his Brother was put into his Room, but he being too good and too grave a Man, his Soldiers kill'd him about 7 Days after. Then <hi>Valerius Aulerianus</hi> reign'd. He had been employ'd by <hi>Claudius</hi> to expell the <hi>Goths</hi> out of <hi>Thrace,</hi> and after his Death was invested with the Purple Dignity by the Soldiers. This <hi>Valeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> wag'd War with the <hi>Insubres</hi> very successfully, and after he had conquer'd the <hi>Goths</hi> march'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> and having punish'd several Persons for their Seditious attempts, undertook a War in order to recover the Provinces in <hi>Syria</hi> and to the Eastward, which <hi>Zenobia</hi> a Woman of Courage and Resolution was then possess'd of, as being Guardian to her own Children, the Provinces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remitted to her care by <hi>Odenatus</hi> her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who made a great Figure in the time of <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienus.</hi>

               <p n="10">10. Wherever <hi>Caesar</hi> went, he routed the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> in <hi>Illyricum, Thrace</hi> and several other Places, and at last when he came to the Queen's Country, after some doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and dangerous Engagements, routed the Army and took her Prisoner, notwithstanding that she had made a very vigorous resistance as confiding in the assistance of the <hi>Persians</hi> and <hi>Armenians.</hi>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:136207:273"/> The chief Town of that Country was <hi>Palmyra,</hi> the Citizens whereof rebell'd after <hi>Caesar's</hi> return into <hi>Europe,</hi> and kill'd the Governor and set up a Garrison of their own. Whereupon the Emperor return'd, took the City, raz'd it to the Ground, and put all to the Sword without sparing either Age or Sex. After that he reduc'd <hi>Aegypt</hi> which had then revolted, and added <hi>Gallia</hi> once more to the <hi>Roman</hi> Dominions. This done, he made a triumphal Procession at <hi>Rome,</hi> and then march'd thro' <hi>Illyricum,</hi> and wag'd War with the <hi>Persians;</hi> but upon his Journey was kill'd by his own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticks.</p>
               <p n="11">11. After his Death there was an <hi>Interregnum</hi> for 8 Months, both the <hi>Senate</hi> and the Soldiers mutually declining the election. At length <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> was elected, who in the 6th Month dy'd at <hi>Tarsus</hi> of a Feaver. Upon his Death-bed the <hi>Senators</hi> desir'd him not to leave the Succession to his own Children, but to some Man of Probity and Virtue. The Man he pitch'd upon was <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> who being approv'd of both by the Army and the <hi>Senate,</hi> master'd <hi>Gallia,</hi> and defeated the <hi>German Francks</hi> who inhabited it, in several Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels.</p>
               <p n="12">12. In <hi>Illyricum</hi> he conquer'd the <hi>Sarmatians</hi> and several other Nations, and as he pass'd thro' <hi>Thrace</hi> retain'd all the <hi>Barbarians</hi> by the Glory of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the greatness of their Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. He reduc'd <hi>Asia,</hi> and the sole fame of his Actions mov'd the <hi>Parthian</hi> King to sue for Peace. He made a Peace with the <hi>Persians,</hi> and as he return'd from <hi>Persia</hi> to <hi>Thrace,</hi> translated the conquer'd Forreigners to the <hi>Roman</hi> Ground, some of whom prov'd true, and others rebell'd,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:136207:274"/> but most of 'em were afterwards crush'd, and the rebellions which happen'd in <hi>France Spain</hi> and <hi>Britany</hi> were likewise quell'd. After that he march'd thro' <hi>Illyricum</hi> in order to wage War with the <hi>Persians,</hi> and upon the Road was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiously murder'd by his own Men.</p>
               <p n="13">13. At this time the Republick was in a flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing Condition. The People were every where peaceable and easy, insomuch that <hi>Probus</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd once to say that he had no occasion either for Legions or Garrisons, and it was that saying that push'd on the Soldiers to fall upon him. Next to him <hi>M. Aurelius Carus</hi> succeeded. He was of <hi>Harbon</hi> a gallick Province. He suppress'd the <hi>Sarmatians,</hi> who became insolent upon the Death of <hi>Probus</hi> and threatned <hi>Italy.</hi> After that he march'd against the <hi>Persians,</hi> master'd <hi>Meso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potamia,</hi> took <hi>Ctesiphon</hi> and <hi>Colchis</hi> the noblest Cities in <hi>Parthia.</hi> After that design'd to carry his conquests further, but was kill'd by a Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolt in his own Tent near the River <hi>Tigris.</hi>

               <p n="14">14. His Younger Son <hi>Numerianus</hi> was along with him; his other Son <hi>Carinus</hi> was Governor of <hi>Gallia.

               <p n="15">15. <hi>Dioclesian</hi> finding himself beset with Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Troubles, took in <hi>Maximian</hi> for his Collegue. <hi>Maximian</hi> compos'd the Commotions of <hi>Africa;</hi> as <hi>Dioclesian</hi> did those of <hi>Egypt</hi> by putting to Death the Heads of the Rebellion.
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:136207:274"/> He likewise recover'd <hi>Brittain</hi> in the 20th Year after its revolt, and in order to fortify the State of the Republick and prevent the Commotions that might arise upon adjusting the Succession of the Empire, adopted <hi>Galerius.</hi> In like manner <hi>Maximian</hi> adopted <hi>Constantius Chlorus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. <hi>Dioclesian</hi> sent <hi>Galerius</hi> against <hi>Narses</hi> the <hi>Persian</hi> King; but the expedition was so unluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky, that he lost the greatest part of his Army. Then the Emperor order'd him to rally and revive the War, whereupon he routed the Enemy, and carried his Conquests to that Hand further than any Emperor, excepting <hi>Trajan.</hi> He took <hi>Ctesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,</hi> master'd all <hi>Assyria,</hi> and recover'd the 5 Provinces beyond the <hi>Tigris,</hi> that had revolted in the time of <hi>Trajan.</hi>

               <p n="17">17. <hi>Dioclesian</hi> having put things to rights in <hi>Asia,</hi> return'd to Europe, where the <hi>Scythians, Sarmatians, Alani, Bastarnae, Carpi, Catti</hi> and <hi>Quadi</hi> were then living peaceably. He rais'd the 10th and horrid Persecution against the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.

               </p>
               <p n="18">18. <hi>Constantius</hi> died at <hi>York</hi> in the third Year of his Reign. <hi>Galerius</hi> adopted <hi>Severus</hi> and <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imian</hi> his Sister's Sons. In the mean time <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entius</hi> was declar'd Emperor by the Life-guards at <hi>Rome. Maximian</hi> slew <hi>Severus,</hi> and took in <hi>Licinius</hi> to be his Colleague. Between these two there arose great Commotions, and thereupon the <hi>Roman</hi> Noblemen invited <hi>Constantin</hi> the Son of <hi>Constantius</hi> to rescue the City from the Tyranny of <hi>Maxentius. Constantin</hi> had been kept as an
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:136207:275"/> Hostage by <hi>Gallerius</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> but escap'd out of Custody and was then in <hi>France.</hi> He march'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Italy</hi> with part of the Forces, and at last ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd towards <hi>Rome,</hi> and cut off <hi>Maxentius</hi>'s Army, himself being drown'd in the River as he fled.</p>
               <p n="19">19.

Some write that the War was occasion'd by <hi>Licinius</hi> his persecuting of the Christians, notwithstanding the repeated advice and intreaty of <hi>Constantine</hi> to the contrary. For when <hi>Constantin</hi> came to the Throne, he embrac'd the true Religion, and became a Refuge and Rock of Security to the Christians, who were then so much harass'd, and e'en almost totally cut off.</p>
               <p n="20">20. By this time the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit thro' Age, and groan'd under its own Weight. When it was of such a sound jolly Constitution that cou'd have secur'd its Health, <hi>Constantin</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd it to shift its residence to a sickly Place, where it was seiz'd with a fatal Distemper. The Emperour translated the Seat of the Empire to <hi>Byzantium</hi> a City in <hi>Thrace,</hi> which he chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten'd <hi>New-Rome,</hi> and invested with equal Titles of Honour. It was by this means that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was divided into the <hi>Eastern</hi> and the <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern,</hi> and so its strength began to dwindle and decay.
